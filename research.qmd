## The challenge of being small {#shrew}

:::{.cr-section layout="overlay-center"}

I study how animals respond to environmental challenges: how their brains, bodies, and cognition adapt in a changing world.

I investigate that in the common shrews (*Sorex araneus*), one of the smallest mammals in the world. @cr-shrew

Unlike most small mammals, shrews donâ€™t hibernate or cache food. Instead, they burn energy so rapidly that they must eat constantly just to stay alive.

This high metabolism makes them particularly vulnerable to seasonal changes, and it makes it impossible for them to hibernate or use torpor.

Their solution? They **shrink**.

Unlike animals that grow steadily over years or those that adapt gradually across generations, shrews undergo a radical transformation within a single lifetime. @cr-shrew-overlay

As winter approaches, their skulls, brains, and even their bones, muscles, and internal organs ***shrink in size***

This process, known as **Dehnelâ€™s Phenomenon**, is an extreme form of biological restructuring that allows them to drastically lower their energy demands when food is scarce. Then, as spring arrives, their bodies begin to regrow, reversing much of the shrinkage in preparation for a season of rapid activity and reproduction.

How does it work? @cr-shrew-cycle

Shrews are born in **summer**, growing rapidly and reaching their lifetime peak in brain size within just a few months. This is the largest their brains will ever be.  [@cr-shrew-cycle]{pan-to="50%,-20%" scale-by="2"}

As **winter** sets in, something remarkable happens: their skulls begin to shrink, their brains lose mass, and their bodies become smaller and leaner. These changes reduce their energy consumption at a time when survival depends on making the most of limited resources. [@cr-shrew-cycle]{pan-to="-10%,-20%" scale-by="2"}

Then, with the arrival of **spring**, their bodies regrow some (but not all) of what was lost. Their **body mass grows to twice its winter size by spring**. This allows them to take advantage of renewed food availability and prepare for reproduction. [@cr-shrew-cycle]{pan-to="-50%,-20%" scale-by="2"}

Shrews **live only about a year**, so this transformation happens just once in their lifetime.  @cr-shrew-cycle

What does the brain shrinkage and regrowth mean for **how shrews think, learn and behave**? @cr-shrew-cognitionbw

The idea that a brain can physically shrink and then regrow challenges many assumptions about cognition, memory, and plasticity.

My research explores what happens when their brain changes size: @cr-shrew-cognition

How does brain size affect cognitive abilities? @cr-shrew-lightbulb

Does a smaller brain lead to simpler, more instinct-driven decision-making? @cr-shrew-decisionmaking

When the brain regrows, does it restore lost functionsâ€”or does it reorganize in a new way?

These questions go beyond just shrews. Understanding how an animal maintains function despite physical changes in the brain helps us explore broader ideas in **neurodegeneration** and **energy efficiency**. 
By studying them, I can ask: What are the true limits of a flexible brain?

### Does Captivity Influence Learning? {#shrew-captivity}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-asp: 1.2
#| message: false
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
raw_data <- readRDS("data/al_data.rds")
model_data <- readRDS("data/al_fitted.rds")
```


:::{.cr-section layout="sidebar-right"}

Brain size is of course only part of the story. @cr-captive-shrew

The environment an animal experiences shapes its brain and behavior. In captivity, animals face new challengesâ€”chronic stress, lack of stimulation, and altered social dynamics.  Do shrews kept in captivity learn differently than those in the wild? @cr-captive-shrew

I tested the ability of shrews to associate an odor cue with a reward in a Y-maze **associative learning task**. @cr-shrew-empty-plot  

Each **dot** represents an individual shrew's decision in a trial.  The **x-axis** represents the trial number, from 1 to 10. The **y-axis** shows whether they made the correct choice (**1**) or the wrong one (**0**). @cr-shrew-empty-plot  

**Summer wild (orange)** shrews had the highest and earliest success rates. @cr-shrew-summer-plot

**Winter wild (dark blue)** shrews showed a similar learning curve, but they learned at a slower rate and did not reach the **Summer** success rate. @cr-shrew-wild-plot

**Winter captive (light blue)** shrews showed no learning, never deviating from chance. @cr-shrew-complete-plot
