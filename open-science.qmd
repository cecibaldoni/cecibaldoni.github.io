## Open Science {#open-science}

Open science is about building a scientific culture that values accessibility, transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration.

This is something I care about deeply and try to reflect in my daily work. <br> My contributions to open science span different levels, from personal practices to community involvement and infrastructure.  <br> <br>
I see open science as a way of working, not just a set of rules. It affects how I design studies, write code, share results, and support others in doing the same. <br> <br>

### What I share

I make my data, analysis scripts, and visualizations publicly available whenever possible. <br><br>Here is a list of resources where you can find my data and code: <br><br>

- [GitHub](https://github.com/cecibaldoni?tab=repositories): my profile and open repositories, it includes some presentations for talks and workshops I organised. <br>
   →  See [Workshop and Talks](talk.qmd#talks-workshops) for more! <br>
- [OSF - Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/jdxn2/): my profile and materials from ongoing or not-yet-published projects. <br>
- [Edmond – Max Planck Society Repository](https://edmond.mpg.de/dataverse/edmond/?q=%22Baldoni%2C+Cecilia%22): in here you can find my data and scripts associated with peer-reviewed articles. <br>

### Community & Initiatives

Open science also means supporting the systems and communities that make it possible. I contribute through organizing, reviewing, and community-building:

- I am an **Open Science Ambassador** in the [Max Planck Society](https://www.openscience-groups.mpg.de/ambassadors), helping build local awareness and promote transparent research practices across the Max Planck Institutes.
- I am an active member of [SORTEE](https://www.sortee.org/) (Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolution), where I serve on the **Member Engagement Committee**.
- In 2025, I am organising the [SORTEE Code Club](https://www.sortee.org/code_club/), a monthly online meetup exploring practical tools and workflows for open science.  
  → See the upcoming schedule [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rOOOE7ghPduwtFftG0DJJf0DXVigAdcmQ0xdEwbKQXo/edit).
- I also work as a **Data Editor** for [PCI Ecology](https://ecology.peercommunityin.org/), where I check the accessibility and reproducibility of data and code associated with recommended preprints.
