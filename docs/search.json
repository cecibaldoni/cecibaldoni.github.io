    "text": "About me\n I am a behavioral ecologist, broadly interested in animal cognition and cognitive ecology.  My research focuses on how animals think, make decisions, and interact with their environment. I use quantitative methods to investigate the drivers and outcomes of cognition. I test animals, in their natural habitat or in captivity under semi-natural conditions, to uncover how these cognitive processes vary across species and contexts.  I have had the opportunity to work with a variety of species, including both birds and mammals, depending on the questions at hand. My current work centers on the cognitive compromises of the common shrew, a model species for studying Dehnel‚Äôs phenomenon‚Äîa remarkable seasonal adaptation that affects brain size and behavior in small mammals.  Recently, I became more involved in open science practices, and I aim to advance openness, transparency and reproducibility in my daily life as a researcher. I‚Äôve had the opportunity to participate to the Open Science Summer School organised by the Max Planck Digital Library and the LMU Open Science Center, where I learned practical tools and strategies to make research more accessible and collaborative."

    "text": "Previous Life\n Before becoming a scientist, I was a violinist, a journey that started when I was five. Over the years, I performed with various orchestras, including the United Europe Chamber Orchestra (UECO), and eventually, this work helped pay for my university studies.  While music has always been a passion, science turned out to be an even stronger driver, leading me to make the switch from professional musician to biologist.  I still enjoy playing the violin for myself and appreciate the creativity and focus it brings to my life."
