## About me

<img src="img/profile.jpg" alt="Shrew Fieldwork" style="width: 45%; float: left; margin-right: 20px;"/> 
I am a behavioral ecologist, broadly interested in animal cognition and cognitive ecology. <br> <br>My research focuses on how animals think, make decisions, and interact with their environment. I use quantitative methods to investigate the drivers and outcomes of cognition. I test animals, in their natural habitat or in captivity under semi-natural conditions, to uncover how these cognitive processes vary across species and contexts.
<br><br>
I have had the opportunity to work with a variety of species, including both birds and mammals, depending on the questions at hand. [My current work](projects.qmd) centers on the cognitive compromises of the common shrew, a model species for studying brain size plasticity and behavior.
<br><br><br><br>
Recently, I became more involved in [open science practices](open-science.qmd), and I aim to advance openness, transparency and reproducibility in my daily life as a researcher.<br><br>
I've had the opportunity to participate to the [Open Science Summer School](https://osip.mpdl.mpg.de/2024/09/20/summer-school-materials-available/) organised by the [Max Planck Digital Library](https://www.mpg.de/807277/max-planck-digital-library) and the [LMU Open Science Center](https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/index.html), where I learned practical tools and strategies to make research more accessible and collaborative.

## Previous Life

Before becoming a scientist, I was a violinist, a journey that started when I was five. Over the years, I performed with various orchestras, including the United Europe Chamber Orchestra (UECO), and eventually, this work helped pay for my university studies.
<br><br> While music has always been a passion, science turned out to be an even stronger driver, leading me to make the switch from professional musician to biologist.  <br><br>
I still enjoy playing the violin for myself and appreciate the creativity and focus it brings to my life.
