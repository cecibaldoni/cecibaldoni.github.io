I work at the intersection of science, communication, and collaboration. 

[My current work](shrews.qmd) centers on the cognitive compromises of the common shrew, a model species for studying brain size plasticity and behavior.

I combine research with hands-on leadership to build communities that empower learning and collaboration. I’m passionate about **facilitating workshops**, supporting digital collaboration, and I focus on making **complex ideas accessible** and **connecting people** across fields. You can see examples of this in my [Talks & Workshops](talks.qmd) and [Projects](project.qmd) pages.

I am deeply involved in [open science practices](open-science.qmd), and I aim to advance openness, transparency and reproducibility in my daily life as a researcher.<br><br> I believe openness is both a technical choice and cultural one, about how we share knowledge and invite others to build on it.

Here are a few highlights of my community impact so far:

- Elected **representative** during my PhD and postdoc, giving voice to peers across departments
- Leading the **SORTEE code club** and helping run the **R-Ladies blog**, nurturing inclusive spaces for data science
- Part of The Turing Way’s community management working group, shaping best practices for open collaboration
- **Translator** for the Raspberry Pi Foundation and **code editor** for PCI Ecology; helping global audiences access science and coding content
- Workshop leader for **R programming** and **personal knowledge management**, demystifying tools to help others level up

I’m always curious about new ways to connect people, ideas, and tools—and I genuinely enjoy helping others learn and grow.

If you want to collaborate, share ideas, or just have a friendly chat, feel free to [reach out](contact.qmd) or book some time to talk.
