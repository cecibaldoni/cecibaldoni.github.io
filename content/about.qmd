I work at the intersection of science, communication, and collaboration. 

[My current work](shrews.qmd) centers on the cognitive compromises of the common shrew, a model species for studying brain size plasticity and behavior.

Iâ€™m passionate about facilitating workshops, supporting digital collaboration, and making complex workflows more transparent. You can see examples of this in my [Talks & Workshops](talks.qmd) and [Projects](project.qmd) pages.

I am deeply involved in [open science practices](open-science.qmd), and I aim to advance openness, transparency and reproducibility in my daily life as a researcher.<br><br> I believe openness is both a technical choice and cultural one, about how we share knowledge and invite others to build on it.

## Previous life

<img src="../img/violin.jpg" alt="20 Years of Violin" style="width: 45%; float: right; margin-left: 20px;"/>
Before becoming a scientist, I was a violinist, a journey that started when I was five. Over the years, I performed with various orchestras, including the United Europe Chamber Orchestra (UECO), and eventually, this work helped pay for my university studies.
<br><br> While music has always been a passion, science turned out to be an even stronger driver, leading me to make the switch from professional musician to biologist.  <br><br>
I still enjoy playing the violin for myself and appreciate the creativity and focus it brings to my life.
