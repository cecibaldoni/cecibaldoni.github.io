    "text": "What do we actually mean when we say something is reproducible? Or replicable? Or reliable? These words come up all the time, especially when you are reading about open science or trying to make your research more transparent. They sound straightforward, but we do not always use them the same way, even when we think we do.\nA few months ago, while preparing a talk on open science (you can find the presentation here), I ran into this tangle: I had reached the part about the four Rs, and, in my head, things were a bit confused. I did what I often do when something does not quite make sense: I made a visual. In this case, I wanted to map out reliable, repeatable, reproducible, and replicable, the way I had learned them. It was not meant to be a final word on anything. I just needed a clearer picture for myself.\n\nIn the infographic, I defined them like this:\n\nReliable: when you use the same data and the same analyses and you get the same results\n\nRepeatable: when you use new data but the same analysis and you get the same results\n\nReplicable: when someone else uses new data and the same analysis and they get the same results\n\nReproducible: when someone else uses the same data and the same analyses and they get the same results\n\nIn other words, these terms all ask a similar question: if we try the same process again, either with the same ingredients or some new ones, do we get the same outcome? The differences lie in who is doing the work, what data they are using, and whether the analysis method stays the same.\n\n\n\nA few weeks later, I attended a great workshop hosted by SORTEE, the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolution. It focused on reproducible data analysis in R, and after the main talk, someone posted a question in the community Slack: “what exactly is the difference between reproducible and reliable?”\nI thought it was a simple follow-up question, something we would all agree on quickly. Several people responded, and as the conversation went on, it became clear we were not saying quite the same thing. Each of us had a slightly different take on what the terms meant (and none of us were strangers to the topic!).\nIt turns out that agreeing on being rigorous is easier than agreeing on what the words mean.\n\n\n\nSo, who was right in that thread? It turns out, it depends who you ask.\nAfter looking into it more carefully, I realised that the same two terms, reproducibility and replicability, are used across many fields, but people do not always mean the same thing by them.\nIf you are working in computational science, like data science or software development, reproducibility usually means re-running someone else’s code with the same data and getting the same output. It is about whether your pipeline works and whether it can be used again by someone else. Replicability, on the other hand, is when someone collects new data, applies the same method, and gets similar results. The focus here is often on reproducible code, or documented workflows.\nIn psychology or the life sciences, things look a bit different. Reproducibility tends to mean reanalyzing the same dataset and seeing if you come to the same statistical conclusions. Replicability usually means repeating the study with new participants, or samples, or data, and checking whether the same effect appears again. The focus is less on rerunning code and more on checking whether findings hold up when repeated.\nIn the social sciences, there is even more variation. Replicability often includes testing whether a finding holds in a new context, such as a different population, setting, or time. Reproducibility still involves using the same data and methods, but with more emphasis on sharing not just data, but also things like surveys, instruments, and procedures. The big question here is whether the result still holds when we move it somewhere else.\nThe National Academies of Sciences tried to create a shared baseline across disciplines in their 2019 report. Their definitions are:\n- Reproducibility is getting the same results using the same data and the same analysis\n- Replicability is getting consistent results when a study is repeated with new data and the same methods\nThe Turing Way, an open-source community guide to reproducible, ethical, and collaborative data science, stays close to the computational science view. It defines reproducibility as obtaining the same results when the same analysis steps are performed on the same dataset, and replicability as obtaining qualitatively similar results when the same analysis is applied to a different dataset.\n\nNote: to be fair, The Turing Way also introduces additional concepts like robustness and generalisability, but I will not go into those here, or I will lose the thin thread of my thought. If you are interested in following up, read them here!\nSo while the words are shared, the meaning behind them shifts depending on the field. Sometimes the question is whether something runs again. Sometimes it is whether it works again. And sometimes it is whether it still matters in a new setting.\nThat is where most of the confusion starts. And, in a way, that is also where the interesting conversations begin.\n\n\n\nDo I still like it? Yes. It helped me understand the conceptual space, and it got a useful conversation going. In some fields, the definitions I used match common usage. In others, they might not. And that is okay. For what it is worth, my version is very close to how the National Academies of Sciences define the terms. But context always matters more than labels.\nWhat I have learned is that it is less important to be right than to recognise that the definitions vary. If you are using one of these terms, define it, even briefly. This can go a long way in avoiding misunderstandings, especially when you are working across disciplines.\n\n\n\nThis whole experience, making a diagram, joining a discussion, watching it unravel slightly, and learning from the mess, left me with a few reflections:\n\nDefinitions are not set in stone. They evolve, and that is something open science helps us see more clearly. When we work in transparent, collaborative ways, we start noticing the gaps and overlaps in how we talk about things. Where you are, what you are working on, and who you are working with can all shape what these terms mean to you\n\nWhen you use a term like reproducible or replicable, take a second to say what you mean by it\n\nVisuals can be powerful tools for thinking and communicating, even if they do not capture every nuance\n\nIf you are confused by these terms, you are not alone. I gave a whole talk on the topic and still walked away with more questions than answers, but also a clearer sense of what to ask next. That feels like progress to me\n\n\n\n\nI made an infographic.\nI joined a discussion.\nThe discussion got a bit messy.\nI learned a lot.\nOpen science is not about always getting things right the first time. It is about being transparent enough to revise your thinking, share what you have learned, and leave room for complexity. This post is part of that process.\nFor now, I will leave the diagram as it is. Maybe I will revise it later. Either way, I hope it gets people thinking, and talking."

    "text": "“We Need Clay!” (or: my citations are always messed up)\nYou know how Sherlock Holmes said, “Data! Data! Data! I can’t make bricks without clay”?\nWell, I didn’t. I had to google it because my brain had somewhat summarized it in “I need clay!”, which didn’t make much sense when I wrote it down. I blame my internal Italian-to-English translator.\nEither way, as a good scientist, I knew I needed data.\nI decided to stick with Logseq for many reasons.\nFirst of all, I love Logseq.\nSecondly, I spent years building a routine of note-taking, so I could just add an additional step. Logseq was the hub for my PhD research, it is where I plan these blogpost, my work tasks and anything important in my life. But one thing is to write things down and another one is to read them again and do something with them (more on this topic coming soon, stay tuned for Part 2 on this note-taking blogpost series).\nWhen I started this “project” I had a very loose plan. The first important rule was to put all the entries together. I chose the tag #SelfReflection (mostly because #journaling was already taken for other things).\nIn the project page, I tried to summarize the plan it in few bullet points:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePhases\n\n\n\n\nData collection: I need data to work with. Record the tasks or activities done throughout the week and write down how I feel about them, but also if I feel skilled at them or not.\n\nMandatory: Write down small and specific tasks. For example, instead of “wrote article” say “wrote 200-word paragraph about the function of AQP4”\n\nReview: After the week is over, check the entries in Logseq for recurrent patterns. For example, things that weren’t real tasks, but did them because I wanted to, needed to, or enjoyed it.\nCreate keywords from the data: Having specific tasks I enjoy/am good at, I can now extract skills.\n\nE.g., “I like explaining concepts visually” → “Visual Communication, Science Communication”\nE.g., “I enjoy breaking down complex topics” → “Content Structuring, Information Design”\nE.g., “I love to create systems for organizing data” → “Knowledge Management”\n\nRinse and repeat\n\n\n\nAs you can see, my initial system was quite simple.\nAnd, as you might have noticed, I already left you with a spoiler: after a few weeks I edited the first point to remind myself that too broad tasks were not the point. But that’s the good thing about trying a system, you can always improve it!\nFor Version 1.0 I created a template that I could call anywhere in my notes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteVersion 1.0\n\n\n\n\n#SelfReflection\n\nTask:\nFeeling:\nEnjoyment:\nSkill Level:\n\n\n\n\nTo make this a real habit, I embedded this empty structure directly into my daily notes template in Logseq. Every morning as I was opening Logseq, it was there.\nI won’t lie, the beginning was extremely difficult. I’m sure I’m not alone in this: you finish your workday, you’re mentally exhausted, but you cannot recollect what you actually did.\nBut it’s like meditation; everyone sucks at it at the beginning. With practice, the process became easier, and I got better at acknowledging the small tasks: “Today I wrote a difficult email, I felt super good about it, even if I wasn’t feeling very skilled.” Done. One data point.\nFor a while, this worked. Then, a new kind of excitement took hold. I wasn’t just journaling anymore; I was building a dataset.\nMindblowing sound.\nAnd if you have a dataset… you have to plot it. I think it’s a law somewhere, look it up.\nThis decision to move my notes into R for analysis was the turning point that exposed every flaw in my simple little system."

To make this journey reproducible for you, I’ll use a small, fake dataset that perfectly mirrors the structure of my real data (for the whole workflow, check the last section!):\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# A reproducible example of the data (after extraction)\n# this mimics what the parsing script would produce\n\nfake_reflections &lt;- tibble::tribble(~task, ~feeling_score, ~enjoyment, ~skill,\n                                    \"Wrote a difficult email\", 5, 4, 6,\n                                    \"Gave Tidyverse workshop\", 7, 9, 10,\n                                    \"Debugged failing script\", 4, 8, 9,\n                                    \"Organized project files\", 6, 7, 8)\n\nThe first problem was immediately obvious. I should have seen this coming. My Task descriptions were unique and messy, with no repeatable patterns: great for a human reader but useless for aggregation.\nThis led to the first iteration: creating a Tag field for consistent taxonomy for my work.\nThis meant exactly what you are thinking: going back to all my entries and add meaningful tags.\nYuppi, she said sarcastically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteVersion 2.0\n\n\n\n\n#SelfReflection\n\nTask:\nFeeling:\nEnjoyment:\nSkill Level:\nTag:\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n# Same fake data, but with tag as well\n\nfake_reflections &lt;- tibble::tribble(~task, ~feeling_score, ~enjoyment, ~skill, ~tag, \n                                    \"Wrote a difficult email\", 5, 4, 6, \"writing\", \n                                    \"Gave Tidyverse workshop\", 7, 9, 10, \"presentation; mentoring\",\n                                    \"Debugged failing script\", 4, 8, 9, \"coding\", \n                                    \"Organized project files\", 6, 7, 8, \"organisation; project management\")\n\nNice! Now I can extract the information and plot it!\n\nfake_reflections &lt;- fake_reflections %&gt;%\n  separate_rows(tag, sep = \"\\\\s*;\\\\s*\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(tag = str_to_title(tag))\n\nggplot(fake_reflections, aes(x = skill, y = enjoyment, color = tag)) +\n  geom_jitter(size=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh. Wait a minute.\n\nstr(fake_reflections)\n\ntibble [6 × 5] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ task         : chr [1:6] \"Wrote a difficult email\" \"Gave Tidyverse workshop\" \"Gave Tidyverse workshop\" \"Debugged failing script\" ...\n $ feeling_score: num [1:6] 5 7 7 4 6 6\n $ enjoyment    : num [1:6] 4 9 9 8 7 7\n $ skill        : num [1:6] 6 10 10 9 8 8\n $ tag          : chr [1:6] \"Writing\" \"Presentation\" \"Mentoring\" \"Coding\" ...\n\n\nI had duplicate entries in my tibble! How?\nWell, better data wrangling people would know already, but it took me a minute to discover the “problem” (if we want to call it problem).\nI used multiple tags per task, thinking it would best capture my experience. If I am giving a workshop, it’s both “Mentoring” and “Presentation”, why choose? It is different than, for example, giving a presentation to a lab meeting. Mentoring could also be other things, like helping a student prepare with their application or interview. I was pretty happy with my recordings.\nBut when you run separate_rows(tag, sep = \"\\s*;\\s*\"), for every row with multiple tags (e.g. “Mentoring” and “Presentation”), it creates a new row per tag, duplicating all the other fields (task, feeling, etc.) for each tag. So, if a task has two tags, you get two rows (one for each tag, but all fields except tag are exactly duplicated). For three tags, three rows. For one tag, no duplication.\nAargh. What now? some entries, like the Gave Tidyverse workshop, were now duplicated, skewing my data. My clever system was an analytical headache. That real-world problem forced me back to the drawing board to weigh the trade-off between keeping this system (it’s not that bad) or clarity.\nI considered a few options:\n\nKeep the multiple tags and duplicated rows.\nForce myself to choose only one primary tag per task.\nIf a task truly had multiple facets, break it into smaller, single-tag tasks.\nAdd a Tag2 field for secondary tags.\n\nI can see the pro and cons for all options. I wondered about what to do. The reason why I wrote it all here it’s because, ultimately, the best option for me could not be the best option for someone else. This is the beauty of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM): “what works for me might not work for you”.\nThe key is to find a system that serves your analytical goals. Do you mind the multiple rows? Maybe not. I can see a use of it: for example if you want to see which Tags are often paired together, and if they are often associated with high enjoyment score.\nBut I am not so interested in that, so I chose option 3. It forced me to be more specific about what I was actually doing. If I couldn’t choose a single tag, the task was probably too big anyway."

    "text": "Defining what matters\nWith my tagging system refined, I was ready. But then I hit my nth roadblock, and I realized I wasn’t.\nNamely, I looked back at my data and realized I was using Feeling and Enjoyment interchangeably. That is not a good sign. There was a reason I created two fields, but what was that again? And why didn’t I write it down?\nI had to pause and create distinct definitions for myself:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFeeling: What was my emotional state during or just after the task? This is about the immediate mood (e.g. energized, frustrated, proud, anxious). It can be influenced by deadlines or context.\nEnjoyment: Did I actually like the task itself? e.g. you can feel accomplished after a task you found profoundly boring.\n\n\nHere’s how the (my) distinction plays out:\n\nYou might feel stressed while troubleshooting code (Feeling: “anxious, challenged”), but deeply enjoy the problem-solving (Enjoyment: 8/10).\nYou might feel calm while doing mundane admin work (Feeling: “relaxed”), but find it intensely boring (Enjoyment: 2/10).\n\nThis clarification fundamentally improved my data. I started noticing tasks where my Feeling was low but Enjoyment was high. For example, I often felt anxious before a presentation (Feeling score: 3/10), but I consistently rated my Enjoyment of the act of presenting as very high (9/10). This simple distinction revealed that some of the activities that are most rewarding for me are also the ones that push me out of my comfort zone. In this case, I maintained Feeling as a numerical score, but I introduced a categorical tag alongside it:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nfake_reflections &lt;- tibble::tribble(~task, ~feeling_score, ~feeling_text, ~enjoyment, ~skill, ~tag,\n                                    \"Wrote a difficult email\",  5, \"focused\", 4, 6, \"writing\",\n                                    \"Gave Tidyverse workshop\",  3, \"anxious\", 9, 10, \"presentation\",\n                                    \"Debugged failing script\",  4, \"challenged\", 8, 9, \"coding\",\n                                    \"Organized project files\",  7, \"productive\", 7, 8, \"project management\")\n\nThis is still a working system. I am not sure yet what do I want to prioritize: the numerical score or the categorical tag, or perhaps find a way to integrate both. I need more data collection before making a decision. But ehi, that’s exactly what I love about taking notes! It’s like this system that’s always growing and getting better as I figure things out more about my own experiences."

This journey gave me a powerful quantitative map of my skills and passions.\nBut what about the stories hidden in the unstructured text of my daily notes? What themes and patterns emerge when I’m not scoring and tagging, but just writing?\nThat’s a story for another time. In Part 2, we’ll leave the numbers behind and venture into the world of text mining to see what other secrets my Logseq vault is waiting to tell me."

    "text": "In the first part of this series, I made a plot.\nWell ok. It was a bit more than that. It was a nice exploration of my work tasks based on self-recorded notes, and in the end… yes, I got a nice, clean plot that put my skills and enjoyment into neat little boxes.\nI could have stopped there, satisfied with my color-coded chart. But here’s the thing about note-taking: it’s addictive. And I realized the real story wasn’t in the tidy, structured scores from Part 1, but was hidden in the unstructured chaos of my daily journal… the digital equivalent of a junk drawer full of brilliant ideas, and existential questions about lunch.\nCould I find meaning in that mess? Let’s find out.\n\n\n\nThe gif i was looking for in the previous part, with Grampa Simpson thinking back and finding only static noise\n\n\nSmall notes before we begin:\n1. This post is structured in chapters, and it’s a deliberate choice. Since this whole adventure is about analyzing long-form writing, it felt right to structure the post itself like a book. We’re on a literary adventure here, people!\n2. Given the sensitive information in my private journal, I decided to paste the actual R code I used, but show you the output as a static image (.png). This was a conscious choice. I tried to create some “fake entries” but I felt they did not really tell the story I wanted to share.\n\n\nI have to admit, I knew nothing about how to analyse long text entries. I had no idea what the process was called, or if it was possible to do it in R. I just knew I wanted to learn more about my writing: know which words I use more often, if there were interesting trends over time, or if I was getting happier (or sadder). Since I didn’t know how to put all of this into actual words, I did what I usually do in these situations: I described my goal to a Large Language Model.\nI should be happy they are not sentient yet, because it might have thought I was being obtuse and ridiculous.\nAfter writing down my question, it just replied: “Did you mean text mining?”\nEhm, I guess. Thank you.\nThe next obvious step was to find a guide. As a sucker for a good coding book, I was thrilled to find “Text Mining with R” online, which became my manual for this adventure.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT COMMUNICATION\nHere, I need to take a pause and acknowledge something important. Despite my love for Logseq, not everybody uses it (say whaaaat!). I debated with myself whether to add this section at all, and jump into the text mining part with a nice fake dataset created in R for the occasion. But reality is never that easy and tidy. So… If you are following along, and you too take your long notes in Logseq (or Obsidian, for that matter), you might get to similar data wrangling impasses. For that reason, I decided to keep this part. If you have never used Logseq and you are just in for the ride, this might be less interesting for you, and you might want to skip to the part where the data is tidy and ready for analysis.\n\nBefore any analysis, I had to get my data out of Logseq and into R. This involves looping through all your journal files and pulling out any lines, and blocks, that contain your target tags (mine were #journaling, and #moodlog). This is very similar to the loop I wrote for the Part 1 of this series, I just swapped the tags:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nlogseq_path &lt;- \"~/Logseq/journals\"\nmd_files &lt;- list.files(logseq_path, pattern = \"\\\\.md$\", full.names = TRUE)\n\nextract_entries &lt;- function(file_path) {\n  lines &lt;- readLines(file_path, warn = FALSE)\n  file_date &lt;- str_extract(basename(file_path), \"\\\\d{4}_\\\\d{2}_\\\\d{2}\") %&gt;% ymd()\n  \n  result &lt;- list()\n  i &lt;- 1\n  \n  while (i &lt;= length(lines)) {\n    line &lt;- lines[i]\n    if (str_detect(line, \"moodlog|journaling\")) {\n      \n      matched_tag &lt;- str_extract(line, \"moodlog|journaling\")\n      entry_lines &lt;- c(line)\n      i &lt;- i + 1\n      \n      while (\n        i &lt;= length(lines) &&\n        (str_detect(lines[i], \"^\\\\s\") && !str_detect(lines[i], \"^\\\\s*-\\\\s?#moodlog|#journaling\"))\n      ) {\n        entry_lines &lt;- c(entry_lines, lines[i])\n        i &lt;- i + 1\n      }\n      \n      result &lt;- append(result, list(tibble(\n        date = file_date,\n        file = basename(file_path),\n        tag = matched_tag,\n        entry_text = paste(entry_lines, collapse = \"\\n\")\n      )))\n    } else {\n      i &lt;- i + 1\n    }\n  }\n  if (length(result) &gt; 0) {\n    bind_rows(result)\n  } else {\n    NULL\n  }\n}\n\n\nentries &lt;- map_df(md_files, extract_entries)\n\nAfter running this, you’re left with a data frame. But it’s not pretty: it’s a raw data dump full of markdown syntax with weird tabs (\\t), newlines (\\n), and automated metadata.\nHere is an example of how it might look like, built with some fake entries:\n\nThere are several problems when you import this from Logseq into R. If you like Logseq for its block structure, know that that becomes your nightmare. If you add new lines, or tags, or any other plugin feature, they are all gonna be written there.\nHere is what I did to clean up this mess.\nWeapon 1: fixed() for str_remove_all()\nOf course, the process wasn’t smooth. I hit a syntax error trying to clean a {renderer :wordcount_} tag from Logseq (side note: that’s the function I use to count the words in my long writing within Logseq. It’s pretty neat, unless you want to load the data into R). The problem is that the str_remove_all() function thinks I’m being difficult by giving it a complex search pattern. Apparently, the curly braces are confusing the function.\nThe fix? fixed() (drum roll sound), which tells R to stop trying to be clever and just find the literal text. I don’t know about you, but adding “fixed” into a line of code makes it all better. It should be the default.\nWeapon 2: Surgical strikes on metadata\nThen there was the problem about the metadata. First, there was collapsed::true, which is just my way of telling Logseq to hide children blocks. It means if I step away from my laptop to get a coffee, my wandering thoughts don’t become public reading material for anyone walking by. The other one was :LOGBOOK: ... :END:, metadata automatically generated by Logseq’s time-tracking feature. It’s meant to record how long it passed from “assigning a task” to completing it. They are structured metadata, so they will definitely contaminate the text analysis.\nWhat to do with those? Remove the entire lines. This is better than excluding the whole entry because it preserves any useful text that might be on the same line, while getting rid of all the noisy metadata.\nWeapon 3: str_squish()\nHave you heard about this function? It removes all the weird extra spaces from your text. It’s an absolute lifesaver.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nentries &lt;- entries %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    entry_text = entry_text %&gt;%\n      str_remove(\"journaling|moodlog\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(\"\\\\n|\\\\t\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(\"-|#|\\\\|\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(\"\\\\[\\\\[.*?\\\\]\\\\]\") %&gt;%\n      \n      str_remove_all(\":LOGBOOK:.*?:END:\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(\"collapsed:: true\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(fixed(\"{{renderer :wordcount_}}\")) %&gt;%\n      \n      str_squish()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nI had all the entries in R, I had a date column, and a text column. What now?\nWell, let’s follow the book.\nThe tidy text book uses as an example Jane Austen books, from the package janeaustenr. Of course, using great literature would be way cooler (more words, for one, and probably better words too), but we will battle imposter syndrome and convince ourselves that our entries have nothing to compete with.\nWell, no offense to Jane Austen, but my own messy journal entries are the most interesting part of this project for me.\nThe first important step is to remove stop_words, meaning all the articles, prepositions and “fillers” words. You can use a specific dataset embedded in tidytext. Without the filler words, what remains it’s only important stuff (well, let’s see!).\nWhich is the most used word in my journal entries?\n\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\nwords_counted &lt;- entries %&gt;%\n  unnest_tokens(word, entry_text) %&gt;%\n  anti_join(stop_words) %&gt;% \n  count(word, sort = TRUE)\n\nwords_counted  %&gt;% \n  filter(n &gt; 6) %&gt;% \n  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(n,word)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\nFun fact! From my own entries the most used word was “Time”. Which I found very intriguing.\nA funnier fact? That’s the second most used word in the Jane Austen books! Take that Jane Austen!\nActually, it’s also the first word for Brontë and Horwell, isn’t that interesting?\nWant to do this yourself? The core of it is using unnest_tokens() to create one word per row and count() to tally them up.\n\n\n\nKnowing what I write about is interesting, but the next logical step is to figure out how I felt when I was writing it. This is where sentiment analysis comes in. There are several different methods, or “lexicons,” available in R that assign positive or negative scores to words. I tried many using my dataset, but for simplicity, here I will use the one called “AFINN”.\nThe AFINN lexicon is essentially a word list where each word is rated on a scale from -5 (very negative) to +5 (very positive). The process is quite simple: the code goes through each words in my journal entries, finds all the words that exist in the AFINN list, and then adds up their scores. An entry with words like “amazing” and “happy” would get a high positive score, while an entry with “terrible” and “stress” would get a negative one.\nThe get_sentiment() function from the syuzhet package does all this work for you, creating a single sentiment score for each day’s entry.\nThe first thing I did was plot the sentiment score of my entries over time. This is where the story took another sharp turn.\n\nlibrary(syuzhet)\n\nsentiment &lt;- entries %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # Using 'afinn'\n    sentiment_score = get_sentiment(entry_text, method = \"afinn\")\n  )\n\n# Plot sentiment over time\nggplot(sentiment, aes(x = date, y = sentiment_score)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"purple\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_point(aes(colour = tag)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, color = \"orange\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(x = \"Date\", y = \"Sentiment Score\")\n\n\nIs it my impression or is there a bit of a gap? How come?\nThen I looked at the dates and realised: that’s when I was writing my dissertation! I remember now, the tag I was using during that time was #Dissertation Journal, to distinguish it from other entries. I should add those entries too. Well, easy enough, I could re-run my loop, adding an additional tag!\n\nextract_entries &lt;- function(file_path) {\n  lines &lt;- readLines(file_path, warn = FALSE)\n  file_date &lt;- str_extract(basename(file_path), \"\\\\d{4}_\\\\d{2}_\\\\d{2}\") %&gt;% ymd()\n  \n  result &lt;- list()\n  i &lt;- 1\n  \n  while (i &lt;= length(lines)) {\n    line &lt;- lines[i]\n    if (str_detect(line, \"moodlog|journaling|Dissertation Journal\")) { #Add the additional tag!\n      \n      matched_tag &lt;- str_extract(line, \"moodlog|journaling|Dissertation Journal\") #Here too!\n      entry_lines &lt;- c(line)\n      i &lt;- i + 1\n      \n      while (\n        i &lt;= length(lines) &&\n        (str_detect(lines[i], \"^\\\\s\") && !str_detect(lines[i], \"^\\\\s*-\\\\s?#moodlog|#journaling\"))\n      ) {\n        entry_lines &lt;- c(entry_lines, lines[i])\n        i &lt;- i + 1\n      }\n      \n      # Save entry\n      result &lt;- append(result, list(tibble(\n        date = file_date,\n        file = basename(file_path),\n        tag = matched_tag,\n        entry_text = paste(entry_lines, collapse = \"\\n\")\n      )))\n    } else {\n      i &lt;- i + 1\n    }\n  }\n  if (length(result) &gt; 0) {\n    bind_rows(result)\n  } else {\n    NULL\n  }\n}\n\nentries &lt;- map_df(md_files, extract_entries)\n\nentries &lt;- entries %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    entry_text = entry_text %&gt;%\n      str_remove(\"journaling|moodlog|Dissertation Journal\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(\"\\\\n|\\\\t\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(\"-|#|\\\\|\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(\"\\\\[\\\\[.*?\\\\]\\\\]\") %&gt;%\n      \n      str_remove_all(\":LOGBOOK:.*?:END:\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(\"logseq.orderlisttype::\") %&gt;% \n      \n      str_remove_all(\"collapsed:: true\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(fixed(\"{{renderer :wordcount_}}\")) %&gt;% \n      \n      str_squish()\n  )\n\nsentiment &lt;- entries %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # Using 'afinn'\n    sentiment_score = get_sentiment(entry_text, method = \"afinn\")\n  )\n\n# Re-plot\nggplot(sentiment, aes(x = date, y = sentiment_score)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"purple\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_point(aes(colour = tag)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, color = \"orange\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(x = \"Date\", y = \"Sentiment Score\")\n\n\nThis seems about right! I am happy I left the tags in the dataset now, I could see the evolution of my journaling, from moodlog to journaling, with a big sidetrack project in the middle!\nThe tag column could also have a new meaning. I could now FOR EXAMPLE visualise if I was more prone to use negative words while writing my dissertation (no, we are not going there. It was just a thought).\nBut with these new entries, what about my most used words now?\n\n# Re-run word frequency with the new tag\n\nwords_counted &lt;- entries %&gt;%\n  unnest_tokens(word, entry_text) %&gt;%\n  anti_join(stop_words) %&gt;% \n  count(word, sort = TRUE)\n\nwords_counted  %&gt;% \n  filter(n &gt; 20) %&gt;% \n  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(n,word)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\nAfter including my dissertation entries, the word frequency analysis had completely changed. My most used word was not time anymore, but paper.\nLOL. Yes, I literally laughed out loud on this one.\n\n\nTo understand what was driving these scores, I wanted to see the most common positive and negative words. The tidytext book has a fantastic visualization for this: a comparison word cloud.\n\npositive_negative_words &lt;- entries %&gt;%\n  # i need to tokenize into single words\n  unnest_tokens(word, entry_text) %&gt;%\n  inner_join(get_sentiments(\"bing\")) %&gt;%\n  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE)\n\n# We need to pivot the data into a matrix format:\n# one row per word, one column for \"positive\", one for \"negative\".\n\npositive_negative_words %&gt;%\n  acast(word ~ sentiment, value.var = \"n\", fill = 0) %&gt;%\n  comparison.cloud(\n    colors = c(\"firebrick\", \"steelblue\"),\n    max.words = 100\n  )\n\n#LOL shrew is a NEGATIVE word XD \n\n\nThis is where things get both interesting and messy.\nApparently “shrew” is a negative word! I might need to thank Shakespeare for that. But when the shrew is your actual study species, the word doesn’t quite have the same meaning as in The Taming of the Shrew, right?\nBut I also see other problems. For example, “excel” could mean the verb, or it could mean I was frustrated with Microsoft Excel. “Chronic” and “stress” likely refer to a study I was working on about chronic stress, not my chronic stress.\nAnd what about “regression”? I am sure I never meant it negatively, I was probably talking about statistics (wait, that does not exclude the negative connotation tho!)\nIt’s fascinating. Have you ever wondered how many scientific terms have a negative meaning? “Issue”, “regression”, “plot”… it’s a long list!\nI’m also amused by how often the word “like” appears on the positive side. Am I using it too much in my writing?\n\n\n\n\nAfter wrestling with the beautiful mess of the word cloud, I could finally stop looking at individual words and start searching for broader patterns in my own emotional week.\nWas there a rhythm to my moods? A secret logic to my good and bad days?\nThis is where Logseq’s structure really shines. Since every journal entry is automatically tied to a daily note, getting the day of the week is incredibly simple with the wday() function from the lubridate package. I decided to look at the average sentiment for each day of the week, and that’s when I found it. A clear, undeniable pattern.\nApparently, my week has a villain, and its name is Friday.\n\nlibrary(lubridate) # For wday()\n\n# It should have columns for 'date' and 'sentiment_score'\n\nworkweek_sentiment &lt;- sentiment %&gt;%\n  mutate(day_of_week = wday(date, label = TRUE, week_start = 1)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(day_of_week) %&gt;%\n  filter(!(day_of_week %in% c(\"Sa\", \"So\"))) %&gt;% #let's remove saturday and sunday!\n  summarise(\n    avg_sentiment = mean(sentiment_score, na.rm = TRUE),\n    entry_count = n()\n  )\n\nggplot(workweek_sentiment, aes(x = day_of_week, y = avg_sentiment, fill = day_of_week)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Day of the Week\",\n    y = \"Average Sentiment Score\"\n  )\n\nweek_sentiment &lt;- sentiment %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # Get the day of the week from the date\n    day_of_week = wday(date, label = TRUE, week_start = 1)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(day_of_week) %&gt;%\n  #filter(!(day_of_week %in% c(\"Sa\", \"So\"))) %&gt;% #let's remove saturday and sunday!\n  summarise(\n    # Calculate the average sentiment for each day\n    avg_sentiment = mean(sentiment_score, na.rm = TRUE),\n    entry_count = n()\n  )\n\nggplot(week_sentiment, aes(x = day_of_week, y = avg_sentiment, fill = day_of_week)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  #geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Day of the Week\",\n    y = \"Average Sentiment Score\"\n  )\n\n\n\nSide note: If you are wondering about the weeknames, just know they are in German!\nMy mood consistently takes a nosedive at the end of the work week, hitting a low on Friday. But the story gets more interesting when you look at the weekend. The sentiment shoots up dramatically on Sundays. The contrast was so stark that I ended up making two plots: one showing just the weekdays, and another including the weekend for comparison.\nIt was one of those moments where data confirms a vague feeling you’ve had for years.\nWho knew? Well, a part of me did, I guess. But seeing it as a data point makes it real. It’s no longer just “a bad day”; it’s a predictable rhythm. And once you see the pattern, you can start to do something about it. This is a discovery I can now be mindful of: I could, for example, schedule lighter tasks for Fridays or just be a little kinder to myself when the end-of-week slump hits.\n\n\nAfter looking at my main themes, I got curious. What about the stop_words? Could they tell a story too?\nI started thinking about it when I saw the word “like” so often repeated. I am not sure I use it in my writing as a verb, but more like… well, exactly like that. I would find it interesting to investigate which stop words I use more often, and if I should rethink the way I write.\n\n# Find and count only the stop words\nstop_words_counted &lt;- entries %&gt;%\n  unnest_tokens(word, entry_text) %&gt;%\n  # Keep only the words that are in the stop_words list\n  inner_join(stop_words, by = c(\"word\" = \"word\")) %&gt;%\n  count(word, sort = TRUE)\n\nstop_words_counted %&gt;% \n  filter(n &gt; 50) %&gt;% \n  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(n,word)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\nOk, using the whole stop-words dataset might not have much information. The fact that “I” and “the” are the most used ones doesn’t tell me much on its own.\nBut I could filter out of this dataset. For example, I started with modal verbs. I wanted to see if I was a person of ‘shoulds,’ ‘coulds,’ or ‘wants.’ Then I went over the pronouns, then conjunctions and time transition words.\n\nstop_words_counted %&gt;% \n  filter(word %in% c(\"should\", \"could\", \"would\", \"will\", \"want\", \"shall\", \"can\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(n,word)) +\n  geom_col()\n\nstop_words_counted %&gt;% \n  filter(word %in% c(\"i\", \"me\", \"my\", \"myself\", \"you\", \"your\", \"he\", \"she\", \"they\", \"we\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(n,word)) +\n  geom_col()\n\nstop_words_counted %&gt;% \n  filter(word %in% c(\"but\", \"however\", \"although\", \"because\", \"so\", \"therefore\", \"then\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(n,word)) +\n  geom_col()\n\nstop_words_counted %&gt;% \n  filter(word %in% c(\"before\", \"after\", \"during\", \"since\", \"until\", \"ago\", \"within\"))  %&gt;% \n  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(n,word)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n   \n\n\n\n\nThe “Text Mining with R” book is full of other amazing techniques, and I tried a couple more.\nI first tried word correlation to see which words I tend to associate with each other. The results were interesting but didn’t tell me anything I didn’t already expect (yes, dissertation is correlated with paper or writing).\nNext, I tried topic modeling to see if an algorithm could automatically find the hidden themes in my journal. This didn’t work as well as I’d hoped, likely because my journal entries are often short and context-heavy.\nChecking numbers with bigram was another interesting topic: I had a lot of numbers in my entries (often coupled with “minutes” or “weeks”, or maybe plain schedules) and I tried to couple numbers with their words, but that didn’t work: I somehow filtered some information from my dataset (the shrews ID from my dissertation have are unique number combinations) so that was a bit of a bummer.\nWhile these didn’t produce mind-blowing results for my specific dataset, they are incredibly powerful techniques. If you want to learn more, I highly recommend checking out the chapters on word correlation and topic modeling in the “Tidy Text Mining with R” book!\n\n\nI approached this project as a beginner, wanting to see if I could find a story in the massive amount of text in my Logseq vault. The mission was biased, of course; I wanted to learn something about myself.\nAnd I did. I learned that my focus shifted dramatically during my dissertation, that my mood has a weekly rhythm, and that the tools to find these insights are accessible to anyone willing to learn.\nWe all have a massive, unstructured dataset of our own lives in our notes, emails, or calendars. It might look like junk, but it’s also a goldmine. The tools to explore it are more accessible than ever, and the only prerequisite is a little bit of curiosity.\nSo, is note-taking that powerful? It’s powerful enough to turn forgotten thoughts into a map of who you are. And for me, that’s powerful enough."

    "text": "I have to admit, I knew nothing about how to analyse long text entries. I had no idea what the process was called, or if it was possible to do it in R. I just knew I wanted to learn more about my writing: know which words I use more often, if there were interesting trends over time, or if I was getting happier (or sadder). Since I didn’t know how to put all of this into actual words, I did what I usually do in these situations: I described my goal to a Large Language Model.\nI should be happy they are not sentient yet, because it might have thought I was being obtuse and ridiculous.\nAfter writing down my question, it just replied: “Did you mean text mining?”\nEhm, I guess. Thank you.\nThe next obvious step was to find a guide. As a sucker for a good coding book, I was thrilled to find “Text Mining with R” online, which became my manual for this adventure.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT COMMUNICATION\nHere, I need to take a pause and acknowledge something important. Despite my love for Logseq, not everybody uses it (say whaaaat!). I debated with myself whether to add this section at all, and jump into the text mining part with a nice fake dataset created in R for the occasion. But reality is never that easy and tidy. So… If you are following along, and you too take your long notes in Logseq (or Obsidian, for that matter), you might get to similar data wrangling impasses. For that reason, I decided to keep this part. If you have never used Logseq and you are just in for the ride, this might be less interesting for you, and you might want to skip to the part where the data is tidy and ready for analysis.\n\nBefore any analysis, I had to get my data out of Logseq and into R. This involves looping through all your journal files and pulling out any lines, and blocks, that contain your target tags (mine were #journaling, and #moodlog). This is very similar to the loop I wrote for the Part 1 of this series, I just swapped the tags:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nlogseq_path &lt;- \"~/Logseq/journals\"\nmd_files &lt;- list.files(logseq_path, pattern = \"\\\\.md$\", full.names = TRUE)\n\nextract_entries &lt;- function(file_path) {\n  lines &lt;- readLines(file_path, warn = FALSE)\n  file_date &lt;- str_extract(basename(file_path), \"\\\\d{4}_\\\\d{2}_\\\\d{2}\") %&gt;% ymd()\n  \n  result &lt;- list()\n  i &lt;- 1\n  \n  while (i &lt;= length(lines)) {\n    line &lt;- lines[i]\n    if (str_detect(line, \"moodlog|journaling\")) {\n      \n      matched_tag &lt;- str_extract(line, \"moodlog|journaling\")\n      entry_lines &lt;- c(line)\n      i &lt;- i + 1\n      \n      while (\n        i &lt;= length(lines) &&\n        (str_detect(lines[i], \"^\\\\s\") && !str_detect(lines[i], \"^\\\\s*-\\\\s?#moodlog|#journaling\"))\n      ) {\n        entry_lines &lt;- c(entry_lines, lines[i])\n        i &lt;- i + 1\n      }\n      \n      result &lt;- append(result, list(tibble(\n        date = file_date,\n        file = basename(file_path),\n        tag = matched_tag,\n        entry_text = paste(entry_lines, collapse = \"\\n\")\n      )))\n    } else {\n      i &lt;- i + 1\n    }\n  }\n  if (length(result) &gt; 0) {\n    bind_rows(result)\n  } else {\n    NULL\n  }\n}\n\n\nentries &lt;- map_df(md_files, extract_entries)\n\nAfter running this, you’re left with a data frame. But it’s not pretty: it’s a raw data dump full of markdown syntax with weird tabs (\\t), newlines (\\n), and automated metadata.\nHere is an example of how it might look like, built with some fake entries:\n\nThere are several problems when you import this from Logseq into R. If you like Logseq for its block structure, know that that becomes your nightmare. If you add new lines, or tags, or any other plugin feature, they are all gonna be written there.\nHere is what I did to clean up this mess.\nWeapon 1: fixed() for str_remove_all()\nOf course, the process wasn’t smooth. I hit a syntax error trying to clean a {renderer :wordcount_} tag from Logseq (side note: that’s the function I use to count the words in my long writing within Logseq. It’s pretty neat, unless you want to load the data into R). The problem is that the str_remove_all() function thinks I’m being difficult by giving it a complex search pattern. Apparently, the curly braces are confusing the function.\nThe fix? fixed() (drum roll sound), which tells R to stop trying to be clever and just find the literal text. I don’t know about you, but adding “fixed” into a line of code makes it all better. It should be the default.\nWeapon 2: Surgical strikes on metadata\nThen there was the problem about the metadata. First, there was collapsed::true, which is just my way of telling Logseq to hide children blocks. It means if I step away from my laptop to get a coffee, my wandering thoughts don’t become public reading material for anyone walking by. The other one was :LOGBOOK: ... :END:, metadata automatically generated by Logseq’s time-tracking feature. It’s meant to record how long it passed from “assigning a task” to completing it. They are structured metadata, so they will definitely contaminate the text analysis.\nWhat to do with those? Remove the entire lines. This is better than excluding the whole entry because it preserves any useful text that might be on the same line, while getting rid of all the noisy metadata.\nWeapon 3: str_squish()\nHave you heard about this function? It removes all the weird extra spaces from your text. It’s an absolute lifesaver.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nentries &lt;- entries %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    entry_text = entry_text %&gt;%\n      str_remove(\"journaling|moodlog\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(\"\\\\n|\\\\t\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(\"-|#|\\\\|\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(\"\\\\[\\\\[.*?\\\\]\\\\]\") %&gt;%\n      \n      str_remove_all(\":LOGBOOK:.*?:END:\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(\"collapsed:: true\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(fixed(\"{{renderer :wordcount_}}\")) %&gt;%\n      \n      str_squish()\n  )"

Well, easy enough, I could re-run my loop, adding an additional tag!\n\nextract_entries &lt;- function(file_path) {\n  lines &lt;- readLines(file_path, warn = FALSE)\n  file_date &lt;- str_extract(basename(file_path), \"\\\\d{4}_\\\\d{2}_\\\\d{2}\") %&gt;% ymd()\n  \n  result &lt;- list()\n  i &lt;- 1\n  \n  while (i &lt;= length(lines)) {\n    line &lt;- lines[i]\n    if (str_detect(line, \"moodlog|journaling|Dissertation Journal\")) { #Add the additional tag!\n      \n      matched_tag &lt;- str_extract(line, \"moodlog|journaling|Dissertation Journal\") #Here too!\n      entry_lines &lt;- c(line)\n      i &lt;- i + 1\n      \n      while (\n        i &lt;= length(lines) &&\n        (str_detect(lines[i], \"^\\\\s\") && !str_detect(lines[i], \"^\\\\s*-\\\\s?#moodlog|#journaling\"))\n      ) {\n        entry_lines &lt;- c(entry_lines, lines[i])\n        i &lt;- i + 1\n      }\n      \n      # Save entry\n      result &lt;- append(result, list(tibble(\n        date = file_date,\n        file = basename(file_path),\n        tag = matched_tag,\n        entry_text = paste(entry_lines, collapse = \"\\n\")\n      )))\n    } else {\n      i &lt;- i + 1\n    }\n  }\n  if (length(result) &gt; 0) {\n    bind_rows(result)\n  } else {\n    NULL\n  }\n}\n\nentries &lt;- map_df(md_files, extract_entries)\n\nentries &lt;- entries %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    entry_text = entry_text %&gt;%\n      str_remove(\"journaling|moodlog|Dissertation Journal\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(\"\\\\n|\\\\t\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(\"-|#|\\\\|\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(\"\\\\[\\\\[.*?\\\\]\\\\]\") %&gt;%\n      \n      str_remove_all(\":LOGBOOK:.*?:END:\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(\"logseq.orderlisttype::\") %&gt;% \n      \n      str_remove_all(\"collapsed:: true\") %&gt;%\n      str_remove_all(fixed(\"{{renderer :wordcount_}}\")) %&gt;% \n      \n      str_squish()\n  )\n\nsentiment &lt;- entries %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # Using 'afinn'\n    sentiment_score = get_sentiment(entry_text, method = \"afinn\")\n  )\n\n# Re-plot\nggplot(sentiment, aes(x = date, y = sentiment_score)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"purple\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_point(aes(colour = tag)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, color = \"orange\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(x = \"Date\", y = \"Sentiment Score\")\n\n\nThis seems about right! I am happy I left the tags in the dataset now, I could see the evolution of my journaling, from moodlog to journaling, with a big sidetrack project in the middle!\nThe tag column could also have a new meaning. I could now FOR EXAMPLE visualise if I was more prone to use negative words while writing my dissertation (no, we are not going there. It was just a thought).\nBut with these new entries, what about my most used words now?\n\n# Re-run word frequency with the new tag\n\nwords_counted &lt;- entries %&gt;%\n  unnest_tokens(word, entry_text) %&gt;%\n  anti_join(stop_words) %&gt;% \n  count(word, sort = TRUE)\n\nwords_counted  %&gt;% \n  filter(n &gt; 20) %&gt;% \n  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(n,word)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\nAfter including my dissertation entries, the word frequency analysis had completely changed. My most used word was not time anymore, but paper.\nLOL. Yes, I literally laughed out loud on this one.\n\n\nTo understand what was driving these scores, I wanted to see the most common positive and negative words. The tidytext book has a fantastic visualization for this: a comparison word cloud.\n\npositive_negative_words &lt;- entries %&gt;%\n  # i need to tokenize into single words\n  unnest_tokens(word, entry_text) %&gt;%\n  inner_join(get_sentiments(\"bing\")) %&gt;%\n  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE)\n\n# We need to pivot the data into a matrix format:\n# one row per word, one column for \"positive\", one for \"negative\".\n\npositive_negative_words %&gt;%\n  acast(word ~ sentiment, value.var = \"n\", fill = 0) %&gt;%\n  comparison.cloud(\n    colors = c(\"firebrick\", \"steelblue\"),\n    max.words = 100\n  )\n\n#LOL shrew is a NEGATIVE word XD \n\n\nThis is where things get both interesting and messy.\nApparently “shrew” is a negative word! I might need to thank Shakespeare for that. But when the shrew is your actual study species, the word doesn’t quite have the same meaning as in The Taming of the Shrew, right?\nBut I also see other problems. For example, “excel” could mean the verb, or it could mean I was frustrated with Microsoft Excel. “Chronic” and “stress” likely refer to a study I was working on about chronic stress, not my chronic stress.\nAnd what about “regression”? I am sure I never meant it negatively, I was probably talking about statistics (wait, that does not exclude the negative connotation tho!)\nIt’s fascinating. Have you ever wondered how many scientific terms have a negative meaning? “Issue”, “regression”, “plot”… it’s a long list!\nI’m also amused by how often the word “like” appears on the positive side. Am I using it too much in my writing?"

    "text": "After wrestling with the beautiful mess of the word cloud, I could finally stop looking at individual words and start searching for broader patterns in my own emotional week.\nWas there a rhythm to my moods? A secret logic to my good and bad days?\nThis is where Logseq’s structure really shines. Since every journal entry is automatically tied to a daily note, getting the day of the week is incredibly simple with the wday() function from the lubridate package. I decided to look at the average sentiment for each day of the week, and that’s when I found it. A clear, undeniable pattern.\nApparently, my week has a villain, and its name is Friday.\n\nlibrary(lubridate) # For wday()\n\n# It should have columns for 'date' and 'sentiment_score'\n\nworkweek_sentiment &lt;- sentiment %&gt;%\n  mutate(day_of_week = wday(date, label = TRUE, week_start = 1)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(day_of_week) %&gt;%\n  filter(!(day_of_week %in% c(\"Sa\", \"So\"))) %&gt;% #let's remove saturday and sunday!\n  summarise(\n    avg_sentiment = mean(sentiment_score, na.rm = TRUE),\n    entry_count = n()\n  )\n\nggplot(workweek_sentiment, aes(x = day_of_week, y = avg_sentiment, fill = day_of_week)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Day of the Week\",\n    y = \"Average Sentiment Score\"\n  )\n\nweek_sentiment &lt;- sentiment %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # Get the day of the week from the date\n    day_of_week = wday(date, label = TRUE, week_start = 1)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(day_of_week) %&gt;%\n  #filter(!(day_of_week %in% c(\"Sa\", \"So\"))) %&gt;% #let's remove saturday and sunday!\n  summarise(\n    # Calculate the average sentiment for each day\n    avg_sentiment = mean(sentiment_score, na.rm = TRUE),\n    entry_count = n()\n  )\n\nggplot(week_sentiment, aes(x = day_of_week, y = avg_sentiment, fill = day_of_week)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  #geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Day of the Week\",\n    y = \"Average Sentiment Score\"\n  )\n\n\n\nSide note: If you are wondering about the weeknames, just know they are in German!\nMy mood consistently takes a nosedive at the end of the work week, hitting a low on Friday. But the story gets more interesting when you look at the weekend. The sentiment shoots up dramatically on Sundays. The contrast was so stark that I ended up making two plots: one showing just the weekdays, and another including the weekend for comparison.\nIt was one of those moments where data confirms a vague feeling you’ve had for years.\nWho knew? Well, a part of me did, I guess. But seeing it as a data point makes it real. It’s no longer just “a bad day”; it’s a predictable rhythm. And once you see the pattern, you can start to do something about it. This is a discovery I can now be mindful of: I could, for example, schedule lighter tasks for Fridays or just be a little kinder to myself when the end-of-week slump hits.\n\n\nAfter looking at my main themes, I got curious. What about the stop_words? Could they tell a story too?\nI started thinking about it when I saw the word “like” so often repeated. I am not sure I use it in my writing as a verb, but more like… well, exactly like that. I would find it interesting to investigate which stop words I use more often, and if I should rethink the way I write.\n\n# Find and count only the stop words\nstop_words_counted &lt;- entries %&gt;%\n  unnest_tokens(word, entry_text) %&gt;%\n  # Keep only the words that are in the stop_words list\n  inner_join(stop_words, by = c(\"word\" = \"word\")) %&gt;%\n  count(word, sort = TRUE)\n\nstop_words_counted %&gt;% \n  filter(n &gt; 50) %&gt;% \n  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(n,word)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\nOk, using the whole stop-words dataset might not have much information. The fact that “I” and “the” are the most used ones doesn’t tell me much on its own.\nBut I could filter out of this dataset. For example, I started with modal verbs. I wanted to see if I was a person of ‘shoulds,’ ‘coulds,’ or ‘wants.’ Then I went over the pronouns, then conjunctions and time transition words.\n\nstop_words_counted %&gt;% \n  filter(word %in% c(\"should\", \"could\", \"would\", \"will\", \"want\", \"shall\", \"can\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(n,word)) +\n  geom_col()\n\nstop_words_counted %&gt;% \n  filter(word %in% c(\"i\", \"me\", \"my\", \"myself\", \"you\", \"your\", \"he\", \"she\", \"they\", \"we\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(n,word)) +\n  geom_col()\n\nstop_words_counted %&gt;% \n  filter(word %in% c(\"but\", \"however\", \"although\", \"because\", \"so\", \"therefore\", \"then\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(n,word)) +\n  geom_col()\n\nstop_words_counted %&gt;% \n  filter(word %in% c(\"before\", \"after\", \"during\", \"since\", \"until\", \"ago\", \"within\"))  %&gt;% \n  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(n,word)) +\n  geom_col()"

The results were interesting but didn’t tell me anything I didn’t already expect (yes, dissertation is correlated with paper or writing).\nNext, I tried topic modeling to see if an algorithm could automatically find the hidden themes in my journal. This didn’t work as well as I’d hoped, likely because my journal entries are often short and context-heavy.\nChecking numbers with bigram was another interesting topic: I had a lot of numbers in my entries (often coupled with “minutes” or “weeks”, or maybe plain schedules) and I tried to couple numbers with their words, but that didn’t work: I somehow filtered some information from my dataset (the shrews ID from my dissertation have are unique number combinations) so that was a bit of a bummer.\nWhile these didn’t produce mind-blowing results for my specific dataset, they are incredibly powerful techniques. If you want to learn more, I highly recommend checking out the chapters on word correlation and topic modeling in the “Tidy Text Mining with R” book!\n\n\nI approached this project as a beginner, wanting to see if I could find a story in the massive amount of text in my Logseq vault. The mission was biased, of course; I wanted to learn something about myself.\nAnd I did. I learned that my focus shifted dramatically during my dissertation, that my mood has a weekly rhythm, and that the tools to find these insights are accessible to anyone willing to learn.\nWe all have a massive, unstructured dataset of our own lives in our notes, emails, or calendars. It might look like junk, but it’s also a goldmine. The tools to explore it are more accessible than ever, and the only prerequisite is a little bit of curiosity.\nSo, is note-taking that powerful? It’s powerful enough to turn forgotten thoughts into a map of who you are. And for me, that’s powerful enough."

    "text": "On realising the problem\nSix months ago I was shuffling around in my apartment preparing bags and boxes for my first ever campervan holiday. Our plan was ambitious, and extremely exciting. Me, my husband and our dog Otto were going from Konstanz to Lapland in two weeks.\nOf course, not knowing anything about what we might need, we started collecting our stuff well in advance. Clothes (few), food (a lot), dog necessities (Otto was on some heavy medication back then) and anything related to camping, fishing and living in the wild (travel soap, I am looking at you).\nThe most exciting part about our travel plan was to be “web-free” for two whole weeks. Being off-grid and spend some time focusing on family quality time was exactly what I needed (cats excluded, but I think they also might have needed some off time from us, so all was good). At some point, between packing notebooks and drawing supplies, I realised I was missing an important part of an off-grid family holiday: books.\nIt might sound weird, but the thought of books didn’t really come in my mind as early as it should have. That made me think: at the time, July 2025, I hadn’t read a book in over a year. Well, I tried, but I never managed to finish one. In 12 months. Thinking about it now makes me feel uneasy. I used to love reading. I used to inhale books like I inhale oxygen. And for a whole year I didn’t.\nHonestly, it’s not as surprising as it might be. Exactly a year before this idyllic holiday, I submitted my PhD dissertation, a great personal and professional milestone, that left me completely empty minded, and in need of a break from everything slightly intellectual. For the longest time I abhorred the idea of reading like one would abhor the idea of cleaning the toilet with a toothbrush. I was just associating it with work and boring scientific articles, and it made me forget how much I actually enjoy reading.\nBut that was in the past! No time like the present to get back to what makes you truly happy. So I packed my books with the idea of going back to inhale literature. Nothing easier.  For my Lapland holiday I packed 7 books. For two weeks.  My husband was, in a word, skeptical.  “You are never gonna read 7 books”.  I was outraged. If I wanted, I could read twice as much. I read the whole Harry Potter and the Halfblood Prince in 6 hours (true story).\nSpoiler alert: I did not read seven books during that holiday, he was right. But we are not gonna tell him that.\nBeing wrong is never fun, but somewhere between the Arctic Circle and the drive back to Konstanz, I stopped looking at my booklist as a series of intellectual failures and started seeing it as recovery vitamins. I decided right then to document this ‘going back to reading’ climb as a slow, slightly messy, adult healing journey.\n\n\nThe book list\nThis is what the last five months of regaining my brain looked like. I think it’s apt, since usually the end of the year brings mostly thoughts about future resolutions, instead of focusing on what we accomplished.\nWhen writing the draft of this blogpost back in August, I wanted to focus beyond the titles and plot, but also on my growth, or internal decision when choosing one book over another. I like to think that I’ve grown in the past 6 months, even if it might be wishful thinking. So you will find a numbered list of books. I decided to order the books based on when I started them, but the actual number on the list corresponds to when I finished the book. If the numbers jump around, just assume my brain was taking a scenic route. We’re scientists here: we love a non-linear dataset. No spoilers appear here (except perhaps for Dune, but the statute of limitations on a fifty-year-old series has surely expired). As for the ratings, they are purely a reflection of my own debatable taste.\n\n1. “How to become the Dark Lord, and die trying” - Django Wexler\n If you are on a reading rut and feel like you’re never going to get into the reading pace ever again, read this book and change your mind. That is what it did for me. I absolutely loved it. I loved the main character, I loved the way it’s written, I love the slight self-deprecating, and at the same time “misunderstood genius” narrative that just spoke to my psyche. And I loved the footnotes. I am not going to spoiler. I will just say that this book helped me with the quest of going back to reading. It was the perfect way to ease in. I will leave this extract. Because why not.\n\n\n2. “Everyone wants to rule the world, except me” - Django Wexler\n After the first book, the momentum was high. It’s the kind of story that reminds you that being the hero is usually a logistical nightmare and rarely worth the effort.\n\n\n7. “Unnatural Magic” - C. M. Waggoner\n This book was heavy. A 180-degree turn from the previous two, which were so fun to read. The reason why eludes me, though. The plot was okay and the horror-mystery setting was well described. Was it maybe the Mary Sue character? She was quite boring, honestly: beautiful AND smart. It’s hard to root for someone who never struggles.\n\n\n3. “Demon hunting society” - C. M. Waggoner\nA book with such a twist. If I had to draw a plot of this book, it would be a Gaussian curve: a boring beginning, a peak of “oh, there was a reason for that, cool!”, and a quite flat ending. The author’s writing style is really nice and enjoyable, but I would not buy it for the plot alone.\n\n\n\n5. “Dune” - Frank Herbert\n This was one of the books mentioned in my introduction—one I started during the “slump” year but never managed to finish. Honestly, I do not know how I failed back then, because I love everything about this book. So much so that I bought the whole series.\n\n4. “Come Rain, Come Shine” - Kazuo Ishiguro\n\nWhy did I think this was a poetry book? Maybe the pocket size, or the fact that it’s from Kazuo Ishiguro? Why do I assume Kazuo Ishiguro would write poetry? Maybe because the prose is so delicate it might as well be verse.\n\n\n6. “Dune Messiah” - Frank Herbert\nFeels like a transition book in the series. It was okay. Funny that the most interesting character is Duncan Idaho.\n\n\n11. Hotel Avocado - Bob Mortimer\n This is a classic airport book. I love buying books at the airport, because I find my good share of English books (I live in Germany, the English choice in bookstores is relegated to three shelves, half-filled with classics). That said: how is it possible to read a book where you hate every single character. All of them, and for different reasons. That shouldn’t be possible, yet here we are.\n\n\n13. Interior: Chinatown - Charles Yu\n\nDid you know that there is a series from this book on Disney+? I discovered it by chance while scrolling, and the title reminded me I’ve had this on my shelf since ages (2023, probably) Well, the book is great. I don’t know about the series yet, but Jimmy O. Yang is the lead, so I’m already hooked.\n\n\n\n\nThe cats books (Italian Purchases)\n During a trip in Italy to visit my family, I bought a bunch of books on a whim. Without realising it, I bought them all with a common theme, and my mom laughed a lot when she noticed. “You are a cat person now” she laughed “like when you were a kid”. I would like to say that I didn’t buy them because there’s a cat in the cover. But I could be lying. They are also all written by award-winning women.\n\n9. Una stanza per Momoko (Ora ora de hitori igu mo) - Chisako Wakatake\nA nice story, but the focus is on growing old. I’m still too hip and young to relate—or so I thought right before my knee made a horrible cracking sound.\n\n\n10. Vengo io da te (I’ll come to you) - Rebecca Kaufmann\nAn interesting report on an extended family’s “year in the life.” I still haven’t figured out why there was a cat on the cover, other than as a trap for people like me.\n\n\n12. La cura del silenzio (Counsel Culture) - Kim Hye-jin\nThe “slow healing” from public shaming in this book felt incredibly accurate. And it mostly involved feeding street cats and walking the city at night, which is relatable. I also find the English title incredibly witty. Right after reading this book I shipped it to my mom (she liked it too!)\n\n\n14. Un gatto per i giorni difficili (We’ll prescribe you a cat) - Syou Ishida\nThis is likely my favourite out of the cats books. An extremely weird take on mental health, and a strange premise all together. That said, it;s surprisingly comforting and fun!\n\n\n\n15. Il castello dei destini incrociati (The Castle of Crossed Destinies) - Italo Calvino\n The book is great, but the best part of this edition was the 49-page preface about Italo Calvino. I say this, because I know Italo Calvino’s books. I grew up as a child with some of its most famous tales, I studied some in high school, others I just stumbled upon during life. How is it possible that I still find some that I haven’t read yet? But I do, and it gives me the same feeling as opening a can of butter cookies and finding cookies in it, and not buttons.\n\n\n19. Marigold Mind Laundry - Jungeun Yun\n I liked the idea so much, but I think that I fantasized about this a bit too much before reading the book. Probably I was expecting something similar to “Before the coffee gets cold”, but it wasn’t. It’s not necessarily a critique, I guess that the overall magical feeling was over the top for me. (disclaimer: the picture shows both the English and Italian version, and there’s a funny reason for it! I brought this book with me during a trip with some of my besties, and one of them had the exact same book with her!).\n\n\n16. Children of Dune - Frank Herbert\n The suspense is killing me. Is the Preacher Muad’Dib? Can Alia fight the Baron? Is Jessica betraying everyone? And seriously, what the heck is wrong with Duncan? (Lyn was trying to save me from reading this book, bless her heart).\n\n\n17. Thursday Murder Club - Richard Osman\n\nRetirees solving cold cases in a retirement village. It is as good as it sound. I bought the second book of this series and it will be one of my first reads on 2026!\n\n\n18. “The survivor who wants to die at the end” - Adam Silvera\n\nI saw this at the airport right after I got Hotel Avocado. I grabbed it without even thinking because I already knew the universe from the previous books. Adam Silvera has this way of making you question everything you think you know about life. I loved the first book so much that I actually made a conscious choice not to go near this volume until I felt mentally sturdy enough to handle the weight of it. It was a good choice.\n\nLooking back at this list, the numbering is a disaster. It’s a tangle of overlapping narratives, for example finishing 4 books before book seven (even if I started them after). The whole thing looks like a dataset that’s been through a blender.\nWhat this experience taught me is that ‘going back to reading’ is a zigzag. Reading one book after the other is how I always perceived my reading practice, and this is absolutely not what’ I am seen’s happening in this post. Or maybe, that’s how I always approached my bookshelves, but I never realized because i was not documenting the experience.\nThe ‘reading rut’ didn’t end with a grand epiphany. Actually, I’m not even sure I can say it’s ‘over’ in the way a project ends. I’m not ending 2025 with a grand lecture about the life-changing power of literature. I don’t have a reading challenge for 2026 or a color-coded dashboard for my goals.\nBut I do have the stack of book by the bed once again, and a dog who, to be fair, couldn’t care less about my intellectual recovery as long as my hand is still free for belly rubs.\nI’ve just stopped being the person who ‘used to like’ reading."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Last year today, I defended my PhD. But this is not a post about that. Or maybe, but just on the side.\n\nIn August 2023 I decided it was time to start with my dissertation. I was 3 years into my PhD and just started what I hoped was the last 12 months of it. What I didn’t know at the time was if my deadline was realistic enough (turned out it was), or where to even start (read on for more).\nI honestly do not remember how the “Dissertation journal” idea came to be. Likely, I started googling random matches from a pool of keywords with the desperate energy of someone who knows they need help but isn’t sure what kind. When I finally stumbled upon the “Dissertation journal” sphere, I was quite intrigued at the concept. And disappointed at the low number of entries. Seriously, the entire internet’s wisdom on keeping a journal during dissertation writing could be read in under 10 minutes, which is interesting considering that the internet is full of gurus ready to flood you with tips for managing your academic life (e.g. citation managers, writing techniques, time management systems, magical rituals). Apparently keeping a journal specifically for your dissertation is not the most common suggestion. So I took it upon myself to flood the internet with this specific topic. I am the guru now.\n\n\nHere’s something crucial that I wish more people understood: if you’re doing a STEM PhD, your dissertation isn’t just writing. In my case, writing felt like maybe 20% of the entire project. The rest was statistical modeling in R, data wrangling, creating figures, running analyses, checking and rechecking datasets, documentation, literature review - all the computational and analytical work that happens before you can even think about putting words on a page. The ‘dissertation writing’ phase isn’t really about writing; the complexity and technicality of the PhD project take most of your time (and sanity) away, and that eventually needs to be communicated through text.\n\n\n\nTo be completely honest, before starting this “project” I was skeptical. I wonder if you are too. By your third/fourth year of a PhD, I can bet my arm that you’ve tried plenty of systems. Some worked for a week, and most were just added to the pile of things you felt guilty about not doing properly.\nIf you feel the same, just know that I’ve been there. But I also knew I needed a system to stay sane during the marathon ahead, and my usual “wing it and panic” approach wasn’t going to cut it this time. Here’s what I learned: some things are worth trying, even when you’re skeptical. This started as a last-ditch effort to avoid writer’s block, but it actually became the most valuable tool in my PhD arsenal. If you’re staring down your own dissertation deadline and wondering how on earth you’ll stay on track while managing the emotional roller coaster of academic writing, this one’s for you.\n\n\n\nA dissertation journal is a place to track reflections, questions, topics, feelings, progress about your dissertation and writing process. It necessarily is a separate space from your actual dissertation document, meaning it’s not where you draft your chapters or polish your paragraphs.\nHere’s the key distinction: your dissertation journal is for thinking about your work, not for doing your work. It’s not a draft repository where you keep paragraphs for your next paper. It’s not a place where you’re trying to write “good” prose that will end up in your final document. That’s what your actual dissertation document is for.\nInstead, a dissertation journal is more like a conversation you’re having with yourself about the process. You might write about being stuck on a particular analysis, or confused about how to frame an argument, or anxious about whether your research is “good enough.” You might jot down questions that occurred to you while reading a paper, or ideas about how to structure a chapter, or just a dump of everything in your head before you start the day’s work. It’s messy, it’s incomplete, and it’s supposed to be.\nTo make this more concrete: imagine you’re writing Chapter 2 and you get stuck on how to interpret your results. In your dissertation document, you’d eventually write a polished interpretation that fits into your narrative. In your dissertation journal, you’d write something more like: “I’m confused about what these results mean. They’re not what I expected. Does this mean my hypothesis is wrong or did I mess up the analysis? I need to re-read the methods section and check with my supervisor.” That’s the difference.\nBased on my experience and the limited research available, a dissertation journal can serve several purposes:\n\nIt’s a thinking space. Before you try to communicate your ideas to anyone else (your supervisor, your committee, your readers), you need to think them through. The journal is where that thinking happens out loud.\nIt’s a place to practice writing without revising. You write things down without worrying about whether they’re good. You get comfortable with putting messy first drafts on the page, which you’ll need to do when writing actual chapters.\nIt’s a reality check on how much work you can actually do in a day. This was huge for me. You think you’re unproductive until you write down what you did and realize you completed two analyses, revised five paragraphs, and debugged an entire plotting function. Your perception of productivity is often wildly different from reality.\nIt’s a way to get into a writing mood. If you do it before your day starts or before a dedicated writing session, it warms up your brain and gets you ready to do the harder work.\n\nThe blog posts I found back in 2023 helped me understand this distinction between “thinking about your work” and “doing your work.” They showed me how to structure entries and how to view the whole experience without feeling like I was falling behind or doing it wrong. But I also deviated from their suggestions once I understood the core idea, which turned out to be fine. Systems work best when you adapt them to fit how you actually work, not how you think you should work. The point isn’t to follow someone else’s template perfectly, you need to create a tool that makes sense for your brain and your process.\n\n\n\nMost articles about academic journaling assume you’re using a physical notebook, and I honestly don’t really understand why. My entire PhD lived on my computer. My data was in RStudio. My papers-to-cite were PDFs scattered across Collections and in Zotero. My actual dissertation was in Google Docs (before you say anything: yes, I’m slightly embarrassed about that choice). Adding a paper journal to this setup felt like asking myself to split my attention between two completely different systems. I do love a good notebook, and I had several in the past years, but for this specific purpose I decided to keep my dissertation journal in Logseq, the digital note-taking app.\nI talked about Logseq already in other posts, and if I could I would just talk about it forever. But I will keep it short, and just say that Logseq fit into my existing workflow. It has a built-in journal feature, meaning that every day you open it, it creates a new page with today’s date. I tagged my dissertation-related entries with [[Dissertation Journal]], and everything organized itself automatically. To me, this means no “where did I write that on Tuesday?” panic. If I needed to find something, like my plan for a specific analysis, I could search for it instead of flipping through pages trying to decode my own handwriting (it has gotten worse through the years). Plus, since Logseq stores everything as markdown files, my entire journal was backed up through Git.\nWhy did I say that was fitting my workflow? Because I want to be clear that it doesn’t have to fit yours. For the way I organise my thoughts, Logseq is great. But maybe for you somethign else works better: the analog notebook, or your smartphone, the world is full of options. If you’re curious about setting up a system similar to mine, you can find a lot of materials online. But again, this post isn’t about convincing you to use Logseq specifically, use paper if paper works. Use Notion or Obsidian or whatever else fits how you think. The best system is the one you’ll actually use.\nThe point is this: your journal doesn’t have to be separate from the rest of your work. In fact, it might help if it isn’t.\n\n\n\nThrough trial and error, I developed a rhythm that actually stuck. The key was making it flexible enough to survive real life but structured enough to be useful. I started my dissertation journal on September 1, 2023. I stopped on July 12, 2024, the day I handed in my thesis. That’s ten months, give or take. In theory, I wrote entries every day. In practice, I didn’t. That’s fine.\nI had two types of entries:\n\nPre-Writing Sessions:\n\nPre-writing happened before I started working on the actual dissertation. Usually in the morning, sometimes right before a writing session. I’d spend 5-15 minutes getting my thoughts down. Where was I in the project? What did I need to tackle today? What was I worried about? The goal was to clear mental space and get into a writing mindset.\nI came across this idea of “just keep writing” in one of those original blog posts. It’s basically freewriting: you don’t stop, you don’t revise, you just write. No scrolling through your phone for “inspiration.” No staring out the window unless you’re actively thinking. And you write about your dissertation, not about what you had for dinner or the argument you had with your flatmate.\nThis sounds simple, but it’s surprisingly effective. When you commit to not stopping, you can’t get stuck on finding the perfect word. You just keep moving, and that momentum carries into the actual writing work.\n- [[Dissertation Journal]] 3 minutes, pre-work\n\n- `{renderer(:wordcount_)}` Words 124\n\n- Today I will organize the bibliography, so that the paper looks a bit more complete (also with line numbers). Still unsure about the author's positions, and about the title. I will probably need to think about it a bit tomorrow (I will make a note).\n    \n    I will re-read the introduction, just to be sure about the chronic stress part, and how much specific I should be about that in the discussion.  \n    In the meantime, I am re-running the model for the associative learning task with all the data at once. If that does not work I will just put the data like I intended at the beginning: data from the model wild, and data or captive only from the other model.\n\nPost-Writing Sessions:\n\nPost-writing entries were shorter. After a work session, I’d note what I’d accomplished and what I should start with next time. This did two things: it showed me what I’d actually done (which helped on days when I felt like I’d gotten nowhere), and it gave me a clear starting point for tomorrow (or, well… you know…). No sitting down the next time wondering “wait, what was I doing?”\nOn a good day, I could write 100-200 words in three minutes. Other times, I had ten minutes and barely wrote a sentence. I’m saying this because length didn’t matter. What mattered was showing up and doing it.\nExample entry:\n- [[Dissertation Journal]] post-writing 5 min\n\n- Discussion done, still not completely happy with it but I guess it's better to have some suggestions on how to improve it instead of modifying it without knowing what's best.\n    \n    I think the most difficult part of it it's the multifaceted (loving this word) nature of the variables, and how different explanations might interconnect. Now that I think about it I did not really talk much about chronic stress in the discussion, except on passing. That could be a bit deepened somehow, but I have to re-read the introduction and see hoe much detail I should provide.\n\n\nIf you’re starting out, you might consider having a list of prompts. The more you practice with your dissertation journal, the less likely you might need them, but it’s a good starting point for when you have the “blank page syndrome” or you have no idea where your thoughts are. I got my prompts from this blogpost, here are the ones that I kept: - Where am I at? - What did I accomplish today? - What was my biggest obstacle? - What do I do in the future if I find this again? - Is there anything I need to read or learn before the next writing session? - How should I start the next session of this project?\nThese weren’t rigid rules - some days I completely ignored them and just wrote whatever was on my mind. The prompts were there for days when staring at a blank page felt overwhelming, which happened more often than I’d like to admit during those first few months.\nOne practical element that helped me stay consistent was building the journal into existing routines. For example, I hosted weekly collaborative writing sessions with other doctoral students every Thursday morning; I’d connect half hour before for some chat and pre-writing time. Those minutes became part of my Thursday ritual, a structured moment to collect my thoughts using one or two of these prompts before diving the rest into 3-4 pomodoro sessions. Having that external structure helped anchor the practice.\n\n\n\n\nOn March 1, 2024, about halfway through my dissertation journal practice, I started doing weekly reviews where I’d set aside time every Friday afternoon to look back at the week. This became so valuable that I’m genuinely considering restarting the practice for my current projects, even though they’re not dissertation-related.\nThe structure I used was intentionally simple, designed to fit on one page without becoming another overwhelming task:\nWeekly review #reviewing \nAccomplishments \n- here I would list some accomplishments \n- doesn't have to be big milestones \n- small wins count \nSelection of papers to read for the next week \n- Paper 2021 \n- Paper 2015 \nThings to do \n- Finish the paragraph xx \n- Debug the analysis script\n[[Dissertation Journal]] Week Review\nI tagged these reviews with #reviewing so they’d stay organized, and also included the [[Dissertation Journal]] tag so everything ended up searchable in the same place. This dual-tagging system in Logseq meant I could view all my reviews separately or see them integrated with my daily entries, depending on what perspective I needed.\nThe weekly reviews proved transformative in ways I didn’t expect. Daily entries kept me grounded in immediate tasks and helped me navigate the day-to-day chaos, but weekly reviews let me zoom out and see the bigger picture. I could identify patterns in my productivity, notice when I kept getting stuck on the same technical problem, and celebrate progress that felt completely invisible when I was in the thick of daily work. Looking back at a week’s worth of accomplishments reminded me that even when individual days felt unproductive, I was actually moving forward.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest practical benefit was reality-checking my own productivity, which turned out to be wildly different from my perception of it.\nBefore starting the journal, I’d often reach the end of a day feeling like I’d accomplished nothing, even when I’d actually made significant progress on difficult tasks. Writing down what I’d done, even small things like “debugged the plotting function” or “revised two paragraphs of the methods section”, made progress visible in a way that my anxious brain couldn’t dismiss.\nThe post-writing entries also created built-in starting points for the next session, which eliminated one of my biggest sources of procrastination. Instead of sitting down and spending 20 minutes trying to remember where I’d left off and what I was supposed to do next, I had notes from my previous session telling me exactly what to tackle first. This cut down dramatically on the mental friction of getting started, especially on days when motivation was low.\nBecause I was tracking what I actually accomplished each day, I gradually got better at estimating how much I could realistically do, which improved my planning and reduced my frustration. Early on, I’d over impose way too much for a single day and then feel discouraged when I didn’t finish, which would spiral into guilt and avoidance. The journal taught me what a day’s work actually looked like in practice, not in my optimistic imagination - turns out, finishing one good analysis or writing 500 decent words was often a full day’s work when you’re also dealing with debugging, literature review, and all the other peripheral tasks that come with dissertation research. I started setting more realistic expectations for myself. The result? I stayed on track. Like for real. It had never happened before!\nExample:\nI am gonna try with this form of free writing, and then use it as dissertation journal. I would like to make a plugin myself to have both timer and wordcount in the same renderer (not sure if it's possible, but I would like to try).\nRegarding my dissertation project (or well, for now better say my phd project), today I really want to focus on drafting the discussion. having something to work with before the end of next week would be great. Next week I want to put it online so Dina can correct. Before that, tomorrow I will finish with the bibliography and add that. Then today I will finalize the author list as well. I am never sure who should be where in the paper... mostly I want to know about Dominik, Marco and Myles, because they helped with data and paper writing.\nThe pomodoro timer sucks. Need a better timer.\n\n\n\nDissertation writing is emotional work in ways that no one really prepares you for when you start a PhD. There’s imposter syndrome that whispers you’re not smart enough for this, the anxiety about whether your research actually matters or contributes anything meaningful to your field, the frustration when three days of analysis reveals your models were wrong all along (is it the models or was it you?), and the exhaustion from revising the same paragraph twelve times because you can’t quite get the phrasing right.\nThe journal gave me a place to acknowledge those feelings without judgment or the pressure to immediately solve them. Actually, I feel silly writing this down because I’ve never been into writing my feelings, and peace and harmony and hippie-like hairstyles with flowers, but honestly, who cares. Every entry was a set of valid responses to the reality of doing difficult intellectual work, and it was part of the process I needed to move through.\nWriting about emotions didn’t make them disappear (that would be too conventient) but it did make them less likely to derail my entire day or week. Once something was on the page, it somehow had less power over me; I could see it, acknowledge it, give it space, and then create some distance from it to move on to the actual work.\nExample:\n- [[Dissertation Journal]]\n\n- I feel a bit overwhelmed today by the amount of tiny (and big) thing to take care of. From the paper perspective, I feel very close to a close, but at the same time there are many things to finalize, going from the writing to the submission; this will take a while even if I don't want to admit it. The overwhelming feeling comes up everytime I realise there is something missing, or something that needs an addition, or a change, and it exacerbates when I match any of this thought with the realisation that My deadiline was supposed to be two months ago.\n\n\n\nWriter’s block is a luxury you can’t afford during dissertation writing, because deadlines don’t care if you’re feeling uninspired or blocked or convinced that everything you do is terrible. You still need to produce, and it still needs to be done by your submission date.\nThe freewriting approach I practiced in my journal entries helped here more than I expected. By writing regularly without revising, I was essentially training myself to lower the stakes of putting words on a page. Not every sentence had to be perfect on the first try. Not every paragraph had to be dissertation-ready prose. Sometimes writing just meant getting ideas down messily and sorting them out later through revision, which is actually how most professional writers work anyway (I assume).\nThe journal became a low-pressure space to practice this approach to writing. When I sat down to write actual dissertation chapters after months of journaling, I’d already internalized the idea that first drafts don’t have to be good, they just have to exist. This made it easier to draft messy first versions and revise them later, rather than getting stuck trying to make every sentence perfect before moving to the next one, which is a guaranteed way to never finish anything.\nFun fact: I wrote my General Introduction in 3 weeks. Is it great? Absolutely not. Is it done? Hell, yes.\n[[Dissertation Journal]] pre writing (5 minutes)\n\nSuper hard to start with the 5 minutes timer this morning. However, I really needed to write don few things before start working on the discussion. I think the problem I'm having with the discussion is the same I had with the introduction. I feel there are many things to write and point out, but I'm not sure how to connect them. Or better said, I think that each topic is a whole rabbit hole in which I could get lost. For now I think I will start dividing the discussion session in 3 parts: brain, cognition and activity and highlight the results and what does that mean. Then I will go into the more problematic part, like about feeding regimes and how they could affect activity levels and motivation, and try to find all the references.\n\n\n\n\nNo system is perfect, and dissertation journals come with real risks that I think are worth discussing honestly rather than pretending this is a magical solution to all PhD problems.\n\n\nThere’s a meaningful difference between acknowledging difficult feelings and dwelling on them unproductively. Some days, I’d start journaling about feeling overwhelmed and just… keep going down that path. Twenty minutes later, I’d written three paragraphs about imposter syndrome and everything I was doing wrong, and accomplished nothing else except making myself feel worse.\nExample:\nAs the first day truly back into my working habits, it was not so bad. I have now a working discussion draft, that still need a lot of work but it's not a blank page. I think it could be nice to have this pre and post writing free-writing sessions, and would be super great to be able to tag them usefully in logseq so to have them all organised.\nI think tagging them DissertationJournal is not enough, and could be limiting. But I could also only leave it as it is and have them in the respective day. I might need to think how to reorganize things accordingly.\nAnother thing that's buggering me a bit is that lately I feel like I have to google everything, including understanding my own thoughts and review my option. For a simple thing like finding the right tags to use in logseq, I cannot do it on my own and I always try to use help from the internet. This makes me feel quite a bit useless, and makes me wonder if I am indeed good enough for this (or any) jobs, if I cannot even solve a tiny problem by myself, mostly a problem regarding organisation, that should not have a common answer, but depends on what I need.\nReflection can turn into rumination if you’re not careful, especially if you’re prone to anxiety or perfectionism (the Webster dictionary definition of a PhD student). The fix I eventually found: set a timer. When it goes off, you’re done journaling, even if you’re mid-sentence. This forces you to move from processing to action, which is the actual point of the journal.\n\n\n\nJournaling about writing is not the same as actually writing your dissertation, which seems obvious but is surprisingly easy to forget when you’re looking for ways to avoid difficult work. It’s easy to convince yourself that spending an hour on a journal entry analyzing your feelings about Chapter 3 is “productive dissertation work” when really, you’re avoiding the much harder task of actually revising Chapter 3.\nI caught myself doing this occasionally - the journal was easier and felt safer than the dissertation, so I’d keep journaling instead of switching to the actual writing. The fix: be honest with yourself about what you’re doing. If your journal entry is running unusually long or you’re spending more time journaling than writing, ask yourself whether you’re processing something useful or just procrastinating in a way that feels academic.\n[[Dissertation Journal]] pre writing (5 minutes)\n\nI am gonna try with this form of free writing, and then use it as dissertation journal. I would like to make a plugin myself to have both timer and wordcount in the same renderer (not sure if it's possible, but I would like to try). Today the main thing I want to see is if I can bring out otto and manage to take the train at 12:58 to Radolfzell. Every second Thursday I will have a meeting with Dina right before the HF meeting, so it would make sense to just be there, but it is a bit tight with the timing.\n\n\n\nAfter I submitted my dissertation in July 2024, something strange happened: I completely forgot about the journal. Not in a “oh, I haven’t looked at it in a while” way, but in a “this entire practice vanished from my brain” way. For months after submission, it didn’t even occur to me that I’d kept a dissertation journal. My brain just purged it along with most of my memories of the actual writing process.\nI only remembered when I was working on a completely different project several months later, analyzing my note-taking habits for blog posts about personal knowledge management systems. I was pulling together entries from Logseq, and suddenly there they were: ten months of dissertation journal entries, neatly tagged and organized, chronicling a journey I’d somehow forgotten I’d documented.\nThe timing feels oddly perfect. I defended my dissertation on November 4, 2024, and this post is going live exactly one year later. Full circle, in a way that I didn’t plan but appreciate.\n\n\n\n\nI’m not here to tell you that everyone needs a dissertation journal - some people have other systems that work perfectly well, and some people don’t need this kind of external structure to stay on track and process their experience.\nBut if you’re feeling stuck, overwhelmed, or like you need a system to keep yourself accountable and sane during the dissertation process, it’s worth trying even if you’re skeptical about whether it will help.\n\n\n\n\nPick your medium based on your existing workflow. Digital or paper doesn’t matter as much as choosing something that integrates with how you already work. If your dissertation life happens on your computer, consider a digital tool; if you think better with a pen in hand, use a notebook.\nStart small to avoid overwhelming yourself with yet another thing you’re supposed to do perfectly. Five minutes. Don’t overthink it.\nTry pre-writing, post-writing, or both to see what feels useful for your specific process. Some people need the morning brain dump; others prefer the end-of-day reflection. Experiment.\nGive it a real shot before deciding whether it works for you. Two weeks minimum, ideally a month. One entry doesn’t tell you whether this practice will be helpful.\nAdjust as needed because the point is to create something useful for you, not to follow someone else’s system perfectly. If the prompts don’t help, drop them. If daily feels like too much, try weekly. Make it work for your needs and your brain, not the other way around.\n\nThe most important thing: try it even if you’re skeptical. I was skeptical too, and it still helped me more than I expected.\n\n\n\nOne year ago, I defended my dissertation after ten months of intensive work on bringing together years of research into a coherent document. The months leading up to that defense were some of the most intellectually and emotionally intense of my PhD, requiring me to manage not just the writing but also all the technical work that goes into a STEM dissertation.\nThe dissertation journal didn’t make the work easy - nothing could do that - but it made it manageable. It gave me a place to think, to process, to acknowledge both progress and struggle, and to keep moving forward even when I wasn’t sure I could.\nWhen I started this practice in September 2023, I didn’t have everything figured out. I didn’t know if it would work or if I’d give up on it after a week. I just knew I needed something to help me stay sane and on track, and this was worth trying despite my skepticism.\nThat’s the real lesson I want to share: not that dissertation journals are magic solutions, but that sometimes the things worth doing are the things you try despite your doubts. You don’t need a perfect system or complete confidence that it will work. You just need to be willing to start and see what happens.\nIf you’re in the middle of dissertation writing and feeling stuck or overwhelmed, maybe give this a try. Keep it simple. Stay flexible. See what helps. You might be surprised."

This did two things: it showed me what I’d actually done (which helped on days when I felt like I’d gotten nowhere), and it gave me a clear starting point for tomorrow (or, well… you know…). No sitting down the next time wondering “wait, what was I doing?”\nOn a good day, I could write 100-200 words in three minutes. Other times, I had ten minutes and barely wrote a sentence. I’m saying this because length didn’t matter. What mattered was showing up and doing it.\nExample entry:\n- [[Dissertation Journal]] post-writing 5 min\n\n- Discussion done, still not completely happy with it but I guess it's better to have some suggestions on how to improve it instead of modifying it without knowing what's best.\n    \n    I think the most difficult part of it it's the multifaceted (loving this word) nature of the variables, and how different explanations might interconnect. Now that I think about it I did not really talk much about chronic stress in the discussion, except on passing. That could be a bit deepened somehow, but I have to re-read the introduction and see hoe much detail I should provide.\n\n\nIf you’re starting out, you might consider having a list of prompts. The more you practice with your dissertation journal, the less likely you might need them, but it’s a good starting point for when you have the “blank page syndrome” or you have no idea where your thoughts are. I got my prompts from this blogpost, here are the ones that I kept: - Where am I at? - What did I accomplish today? - What was my biggest obstacle? - What do I do in the future if I find this again? - Is there anything I need to read or learn before the next writing session? - How should I start the next session of this project?\nThese weren’t rigid rules - some days I completely ignored them and just wrote whatever was on my mind. The prompts were there for days when staring at a blank page felt overwhelming, which happened more often than I’d like to admit during those first few months.\nOne practical element that helped me stay consistent was building the journal into existing routines. For example, I hosted weekly collaborative writing sessions with other doctoral students every Thursday morning; I’d connect half hour before for some chat and pre-writing time. Those minutes became part of my Thursday ritual, a structured moment to collect my thoughts using one or two of these prompts before diving the rest into 3-4 pomodoro sessions. Having that external structure helped anchor the practice."

    "text": "On March 1, 2024, about halfway through my dissertation journal practice, I started doing weekly reviews where I’d set aside time every Friday afternoon to look back at the week. This became so valuable that I’m genuinely considering restarting the practice for my current projects, even though they’re not dissertation-related.\nThe structure I used was intentionally simple, designed to fit on one page without becoming another overwhelming task:\nWeekly review #reviewing \nAccomplishments \n- here I would list some accomplishments \n- doesn't have to be big milestones \n- small wins count \nSelection of papers to read for the next week \n- Paper 2021 \n- Paper 2015 \nThings to do \n- Finish the paragraph xx \n- Debug the analysis script\n[[Dissertation Journal]] Week Review\nI tagged these reviews with #reviewing so they’d stay organized, and also included the [[Dissertation Journal]] tag so everything ended up searchable in the same place. This dual-tagging system in Logseq meant I could view all my reviews separately or see them integrated with my daily entries, depending on what perspective I needed.\nThe weekly reviews proved transformative in ways I didn’t expect. Daily entries kept me grounded in immediate tasks and helped me navigate the day-to-day chaos, but weekly reviews let me zoom out and see the bigger picture. I could identify patterns in my productivity, notice when I kept getting stuck on the same technical problem, and celebrate progress that felt completely invisible when I was in the thick of daily work. Looking back at a week’s worth of accomplishments reminded me that even when individual days felt unproductive, I was actually moving forward."

    "text": "The biggest practical benefit was reality-checking my own productivity, which turned out to be wildly different from my perception of it.\nBefore starting the journal, I’d often reach the end of a day feeling like I’d accomplished nothing, even when I’d actually made significant progress on difficult tasks. Writing down what I’d done, even small things like “debugged the plotting function” or “revised two paragraphs of the methods section”, made progress visible in a way that my anxious brain couldn’t dismiss.\nThe post-writing entries also created built-in starting points for the next session, which eliminated one of my biggest sources of procrastination. Instead of sitting down and spending 20 minutes trying to remember where I’d left off and what I was supposed to do next, I had notes from my previous session telling me exactly what to tackle first. This cut down dramatically on the mental friction of getting started, especially on days when motivation was low.\nBecause I was tracking what I actually accomplished each day, I gradually got better at estimating how much I could realistically do, which improved my planning and reduced my frustration. Early on, I’d over impose way too much for a single day and then feel discouraged when I didn’t finish, which would spiral into guilt and avoidance. The journal taught me what a day’s work actually looked like in practice, not in my optimistic imagination - turns out, finishing one good analysis or writing 500 decent words was often a full day’s work when you’re also dealing with debugging, literature review, and all the other peripheral tasks that come with dissertation research. I started setting more realistic expectations for myself. The result? I stayed on track. Like for real. It had never happened before!\nExample:\nI am gonna try with this form of free writing, and then use it as dissertation journal. I would like to make a plugin myself to have both timer and wordcount in the same renderer (not sure if it's possible, but I would like to try).\nRegarding my dissertation project (or well, for now better say my phd project), today I really want to focus on drafting the discussion. having something to work with before the end of next week would be great. Next week I want to put it online so Dina can correct. Before that, tomorrow I will finish with the bibliography and add that. Then today I will finalize the author list as well. I am never sure who should be where in the paper... mostly I want to know about Dominik, Marco and Myles, because they helped with data and paper writing.\nThe pomodoro timer sucks. Need a better timer.\n\n\n\nDissertation writing is emotional work in ways that no one really prepares you for when you start a PhD. There’s imposter syndrome that whispers you’re not smart enough for this, the anxiety about whether your research actually matters or contributes anything meaningful to your field, the frustration when three days of analysis reveals your models were wrong all along (is it the models or was it you?), and the exhaustion from revising the same paragraph twelve times because you can’t quite get the phrasing right.\nThe journal gave me a place to acknowledge those feelings without judgment or the pressure to immediately solve them. Actually, I feel silly writing this down because I’ve never been into writing my feelings, and peace and harmony and hippie-like hairstyles with flowers, but honestly, who cares. Every entry was a set of valid responses to the reality of doing difficult intellectual work, and it was part of the process I needed to move through.\nWriting about emotions didn’t make them disappear (that would be too conventient) but it did make them less likely to derail my entire day or week. Once something was on the page, it somehow had less power over me; I could see it, acknowledge it, give it space, and then create some distance from it to move on to the actual work.\nExample:\n- [[Dissertation Journal]]\n\n- I feel a bit overwhelmed today by the amount of tiny (and big) thing to take care of. From the paper perspective, I feel very close to a close, but at the same time there are many things to finalize, going from the writing to the submission; this will take a while even if I don't want to admit it. The overwhelming feeling comes up everytime I realise there is something missing, or something that needs an addition, or a change, and it exacerbates when I match any of this thought with the realisation that My deadiline was supposed to be two months ago.\n\n\n\nWriter’s block is a luxury you can’t afford during dissertation writing, because deadlines don’t care if you’re feeling uninspired or blocked or convinced that everything you do is terrible. You still need to produce, and it still needs to be done by your submission date.\nThe freewriting approach I practiced in my journal entries helped here more than I expected. By writing regularly without revising, I was essentially training myself to lower the stakes of putting words on a page. Not every sentence had to be perfect on the first try. Not every paragraph had to be dissertation-ready prose. Sometimes writing just meant getting ideas down messily and sorting them out later through revision, which is actually how most professional writers work anyway (I assume).\nThe journal became a low-pressure space to practice this approach to writing. When I sat down to write actual dissertation chapters after months of journaling, I’d already internalized the idea that first drafts don’t have to be good, they just have to exist. This made it easier to draft messy first versions and revise them later, rather than getting stuck trying to make every sentence perfect before moving to the next one, which is a guaranteed way to never finish anything.\nFun fact: I wrote my General Introduction in 3 weeks. Is it great? Absolutely not. Is it done? Hell, yes.\n[[Dissertation Journal]] pre writing (5 minutes)\n\nSuper hard to start with the 5 minutes timer this morning. However, I really needed to write don few things before start working on the discussion. I think the problem I'm having with the discussion is the same I had with the introduction. I feel there are many things to write and point out, but I'm not sure how to connect them. Or better said, I think that each topic is a whole rabbit hole in which I could get lost. For now I think I will start dividing the discussion session in 3 parts: brain, cognition and activity and highlight the results and what does that mean. Then I will go into the more problematic part, like about feeding regimes and how they could affect activity levels and motivation, and try to find all the references."

    "text": "No system is perfect, and dissertation journals come with real risks that I think are worth discussing honestly rather than pretending this is a magical solution to all PhD problems.\n\n\nThere’s a meaningful difference between acknowledging difficult feelings and dwelling on them unproductively. Some days, I’d start journaling about feeling overwhelmed and just… keep going down that path. Twenty minutes later, I’d written three paragraphs about imposter syndrome and everything I was doing wrong, and accomplished nothing else except making myself feel worse.\nExample:\nAs the first day truly back into my working habits, it was not so bad. I have now a working discussion draft, that still need a lot of work but it's not a blank page. I think it could be nice to have this pre and post writing free-writing sessions, and would be super great to be able to tag them usefully in logseq so to have them all organised.\nI think tagging them DissertationJournal is not enough, and could be limiting. But I could also only leave it as it is and have them in the respective day. I might need to think how to reorganize things accordingly.\nAnother thing that's buggering me a bit is that lately I feel like I have to google everything, including understanding my own thoughts and review my option. For a simple thing like finding the right tags to use in logseq, I cannot do it on my own and I always try to use help from the internet. This makes me feel quite a bit useless, and makes me wonder if I am indeed good enough for this (or any) jobs, if I cannot even solve a tiny problem by myself, mostly a problem regarding organisation, that should not have a common answer, but depends on what I need.\nReflection can turn into rumination if you’re not careful, especially if you’re prone to anxiety or perfectionism (the Webster dictionary definition of a PhD student). The fix I eventually found: set a timer. When it goes off, you’re done journaling, even if you’re mid-sentence. This forces you to move from processing to action, which is the actual point of the journal.\n\n\n\nJournaling about writing is not the same as actually writing your dissertation, which seems obvious but is surprisingly easy to forget when you’re looking for ways to avoid difficult work. It’s easy to convince yourself that spending an hour on a journal entry analyzing your feelings about Chapter 3 is “productive dissertation work” when really, you’re avoiding the much harder task of actually revising Chapter 3.\nI caught myself doing this occasionally - the journal was easier and felt safer than the dissertation, so I’d keep journaling instead of switching to the actual writing. The fix: be honest with yourself about what you’re doing. If your journal entry is running unusually long or you’re spending more time journaling than writing, ask yourself whether you’re processing something useful or just procrastinating in a way that feels academic.\n[[Dissertation Journal]] pre writing (5 minutes)\n\nI am gonna try with this form of free writing, and then use it as dissertation journal. I would like to make a plugin myself to have both timer and wordcount in the same renderer (not sure if it's possible, but I would like to try). Today the main thing I want to see is if I can bring out otto and manage to take the train at 12:58 to Radolfzell. Every second Thursday I will have a meeting with Dina right before the HF meeting, so it would make sense to just be there, but it is a bit tight with the timing.\n\n\n\nAfter I submitted my dissertation in July 2024, something strange happened: I completely forgot about the journal. Not in a “oh, I haven’t looked at it in a while” way, but in a “this entire practice vanished from my brain” way. For months after submission, it didn’t even occur to me that I’d kept a dissertation journal. My brain just purged it along with most of my memories of the actual writing process.\nI only remembered when I was working on a completely different project several months later, analyzing my note-taking habits for blog posts about personal knowledge management systems. I was pulling together entries from Logseq, and suddenly there they were: ten months of dissertation journal entries, neatly tagged and organized, chronicling a journey I’d somehow forgotten I’d documented.\nThe timing feels oddly perfect. I defended my dissertation on November 4, 2024, and this post is going live exactly one year later. Full circle, in a way that I didn’t plan but appreciate."

Some people need the morning brain dump; others prefer the end-of-day reflection. Experiment.\nGive it a real shot before deciding whether it works for you. Two weeks minimum, ideally a month. One entry doesn’t tell you whether this practice will be helpful.\nAdjust as needed because the point is to create something useful for you, not to follow someone else’s system perfectly. If the prompts don’t help, drop them. If daily feels like too much, try weekly. Make it work for your needs and your brain, not the other way around.\n\nThe most important thing: try it even if you’re skeptical. I was skeptical too, and it still helped me more than I expected."

    "text": "One year ago, I defended my dissertation after ten months of intensive work on bringing together years of research into a coherent document. The months leading up to that defense were some of the most intellectually and emotionally intense of my PhD, requiring me to manage not just the writing but also all the technical work that goes into a STEM dissertation.\nThe dissertation journal didn’t make the work easy - nothing could do that - but it made it manageable. It gave me a place to think, to process, to acknowledge both progress and struggle, and to keep moving forward even when I wasn’t sure I could.\nWhen I started this practice in September 2023, I didn’t have everything figured out. I didn’t know if it would work or if I’d give up on it after a week. I just knew I needed something to help me stay sane and on track, and this was worth trying despite my skepticism.\nThat’s the real lesson I want to share: not that dissertation journals are magic solutions, but that sometimes the things worth doing are the things you try despite your doubts. You don’t need a perfect system or complete confidence that it will work. You just need to be willing to start and see what happens.\nIf you’re in the middle of dissertation writing and feeling stuck or overwhelmed, maybe give this a try. Keep it simple. Stay flexible. See what helps. You might be surprised."

    "text": "Open Science\nOpen science is about building a scientific culture that values accessibility, transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration.\nThis is something I care about deeply and try to reflect in my daily work.  My contributions to open science span different levels, from personal practices to community involvement and infrastructure.   I see open science as a way of working, not just a set of rules. It affects how I design studies, write code, share results, and support others in doing the same.  \n\nWhat I share\nI publish the data, analysis scripts, and visualizations for my research projects as a standard part of my workflow. Cleaning code for public release is a slow process, but it is the only way to ensure the results are actually reproducible. Here is a list of resources where you can find my data and code: \n\nGitHub: my profile and open repositories, it includes some presentations for talks and workshops I organised.  → See Workshop and Talks for more! \nEdmond – Max Planck Society Repository: in here you can find my data and scripts associated with peer-reviewed articles, but also for projects not yet published!. \n\n\n\nCommunity Management and Governance\nOpen science also means supporting the systems and communities that make it possible. Here is how I contribute:\n\nI am an Open Science Ambassador in the Max Planck Society, I advise researchers at my institute on how to comply with data-sharing mandates and use institutional repositories.\nI am an active member of SORTEE (Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolution), where I serve on the Member Engagement Committee.\nIn 2025, I am organising the SORTEE Code Club, a monthly online meetup exploring practical tools and workflows for open science.\n→ See the upcoming schedule here.\nI also work as a Data Editor for PCI Ecology, where I check the accessibility and reproducibility of data and code associated with recommended preprints.\nCode of Conduct Committee The Carpentries: I resolve governance and policy disputes within this international network of data science instructors."

    "text": "Some days ago I was thinking about Sherlock Holmes’s “Brain Attic” theory.\nThe idea is that your brain is a small room, and you need to plan where to put and how to choose your furniture. You throw out the trivia about the solar system to make room for a gazillion varieties of tobacco ash.\nVery Victorian. And very wrong.\nThis idea of a brain being a passive room with with slowly dusting furniture is a complete lie. My brain does not feel like that (I bet yours doesn’t as well).\nIf I had to find a better analogy, my brain feels like a high-stress kitchen during a dinner rush where every burner is on and someone just dropped a crate of eggs. If I try to store a “piece of furniture” in there, it just becomes a fire hazard.\nMy brain is a processing unit, not a storage unit, and sometimes it is overheating because it’s rendering a complex theoretical framework using the same RAM it’s using to remember I need to buy nore dish soap.\nSo instead of keeping information stored there, which will just get in the way of the actual cooking, I dump all of it. I take all the half-baked fragments of an idea and I drop it to a digital page or a notebook somewhere.\nWe talk about PKM as this noble quest for “knowledge management” or “idea generation” or building some master database for the future (though that’s what I tell people so I sound productive). Honestly, it’s pure self-soothing. There is a specific, almost embarrassing, relief in seeing a chaotic thought turned into a static line of text. The moment it’s “out there” the emotional temperature in my head drops by ten degrees.\nI’m just clearing the kitchen so I can hear myself think for five minutes without slipping on the mental eggs.\nNext time you feel that post-journaling zen ask yourself: are you actually happy you saved that information, or are you just relieved you finally dumped it?"

It includes a lot of responses (kudos to the curator of this dataset, Nicola Rennie), along with metadata about users (e.g. self-reported Y chromosome presence, colorblindness etc.).\nRather than focusing on the full dataset, I used a subset to play with structuring and presenting small summaries. The visualizations are extremely simple, but enough to test how different layout elements from quartose could help me guide the narrative.\nYou’ll see a few of these elements below:\n\nSummary tables with side content\nTabs that organize plots by grouping\nNotes placed outside the main column\n\nThe dataset is available in the color project repo, and the TidyTuesday project is a great excuse to learn something new each week (well, that’s my excuse!)."

One interesting variable in this dataset is a spam probability score, meaning (I guess) a numeric value that estimates how likely a given user was submitting low-quality answers.\nquarto_div(content = c(paste0(\"Colorblind participants: \", users_summary$n_cb), \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                       paste0(\"Average spam probability: \", round(users_summary$avg_spam_prob, 3)), \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                       paste0(\"Monitor types: \", users_summary$n_monitors)),\n  class = \"column-margin\")\n\n\nColorblind participants: 5588  Average spam probability: 0.222 Monitor types: 3\n\n\nHow much data?\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  answers named_colors hex_codes\n    &lt;int&gt;        &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 1058211          949       949\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this is a large dataset. People typed in thousands of color names for hundreds of distinct hex codes. That’s a lot of ways to say “blue.”\n\n\n\nAnswers per user\n\nHistogramAverage by Y chromosomeDensity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you’re seeing:\n- The histogram shows that most users gave fewer than 10 answers, with a long tail of power users.  - On average, answer counts per user are fairly similar across Y chromosome groups.  - The density plot shows the shape of participation, all groups are heavily skewed.\n\n\nColorblindness\nColor perception is often assumed to be universal, but of course, it isn’t.\nLet’s take a quick look at how many participants reported being colorblind:\n\nusers |&gt; \n  mutate(cb_status = factor(case_when(colorblind == 1 ~ \"Colorblind\",\n                                      colorblind == 0 ~ \"Not colorblind\",\n                                      TRUE ~ \"Unknown\"), levels = c(\"Not colorblind\", \"Colorblind\", \"Unknown\"))) |&gt; \n  count(cb_status) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = cb_status, y = n, fill = cb_status)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Colorblindness Status\", y = \"Number of users\")\n\n\n\n\nColorblindness status\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpam Probability\nWhat kind of variation is there in users’ spam scores?\nThis variable is a bit opaque… I don’t know exactly how it’s computed. But it’s cool to see how it distributes across groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of spam scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of spam scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs monitor type related?\nCould the type of monitor affect color perception or how people respond?\n\nusers |&gt; \n  mutate(monitor = fct_lump(monitor, n = 3)) |&gt;\n  count(monitor) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = monitor, y = n, fill = monitor)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Monitor Type\", y = \"Number of users\")\n\n\n\n\nMonitor type vs number of users\n\n\n\n\nI admit, I had to google this. Most users had modern displays (LCD or Liquid Crystal Display), but there were still a few on older CRTs (Cathode Ray Tube, that really sounds like something from Back to the Future) or other types, which might influence how colors looked during the experiment.\n\n\nConclusion\nThere’s a lot more to explore. But I really liked the unexpected combinations and perspectives people bring when interpreting color.\nquarto_div(content = \"Want to try your own analysis?

Not really.\nDo I want to try it again? Oh yes.\nI imagine it could be useful for workshop materials or blog tutorials, though I haven’t settled on how I might use it yet. As Danielle wrote:\n\n“All that quarto_div() actually does is construct syntax for the Quarto parser to capture and render.”\n\nThat’s exactly what it does.

    "text": "At some point between 5 and 7 years old, you learned how to write. I’m not talking about penmanship (that came later) or writing a novel (that probably didn’t come yet), but about the simple act of decoding symbols and putting them together to create sounds.\nYou might not remember the process now, but I assure you: you sucked at it. You had to practice for months, years, to get those symbols right. You probably learned cursive too, and that was a whole other level of hell.\nBut you did it. Because you had to, there was no other choice.\nEventually, you learned how to write, how to decode those symbols into sounds, put them together into ideas, and now it’s just… happening. You give it no more thought than you would give which keys to hit on the keyboard to spell a word you’ve known for years (what about typos? Typos are typing mistakes, not writing mistakes!)\nWhy am I starting with this topic, when I should be writing about sketchnoting? Because it’s exactly the same thing.\nSketchnoting is about drawing as much as writing is about creating a literature masterwork. You don’t need to know how to write a bestseller to write in your daily journal, just as you don’t need to know how to draw to sketchnote.\nSo, what do you actually need? Practice.\nExactly like you learned these weird symbols that make up our words, and had to practice to make them look readable (penmanship, here it comes), the same thing applies to sketchnoting. The more you practice, the easier it gets.\n(By the way, it’s the same advice for painting, drawing, knitting, crocheting, programming, learning a new language, taking care of a dog, driving, changing a diaper, or anything else you can think of, but for most of these examples, people still reply, “I am not gifted” or “I could never do it like you do it.”. Sounds familiar?)\nThen, I hope this blog post hits closer to the soul of whomever needed to know this. After reading this, “I can’t draw, so I can’t sketchnote” won’t work as an excuse anymore.\nReady?"

    "text": "The Science behind why it works\nConsider a talk or a presentation. The speaker is talking quickly, and there’s no way you can write down everything they say word for word. With traditional notes, you’d try and fail, only capturing fragments. When you review your notes, you miss the connection between these fragments, or you might fail to remember what was the endpoint of a very convoluted story. With sketchnoting, you’re immediately prioritizing and simplifying as you listen. This act of active processing the speaker’s complex ideas into your own personal language of keywords and symbols is helping you learn while you listen, instead of passively writing words down.\nThis concept is called Dual-Coding Theory. Our brains process information through two distinct channels: a verbal channel for words and a visual channel for images. When you take traditional notes, you’re primarily using only the verbal channel. But when you sketchnote, you’re intentionally using both at the same time. This creates two “mental traces” for the same piece of information, one verbal and one visual. Because the memory is stored in two places, it’s much stronger and easier to retrieve later on.\nAt the same time, we all know that a picture is worth a thousand words. This is called the Picture Superiority Effect, and it’s a well-established cognitive principle that shows we remember concepts much better when they are presented as images rather than words.\nTo sum up, by using both words and pictures, you’re giving your brain two different ways to remember the same information! &lt;br. So, how do you get started?"

That’s way too fast to write everything down, which is a good thing! Sketchnoting forces you to let go of the idea of capturing every word and, instead, to truly listen for the core concepts.\nPrioritizing: As you listen, your brain will naturally start to filter. What’s the main point? What’s a supporting example? What’s just an interesting anecdote? This skill of prioritizing is crucial for keeping your sketchnote clear and focused.\nSynthesizing: This is the most important skill. It’s the ability to take a complex idea and distill it down to its essence. When you sketchnote, you are constantly asking yourself, “How can I represent this idea with a single word and a simple picture?”\n\nThese are the real muscles you’ll be building. A fun side note? They will make you a better learner and problem-solver."

    "text": "How do I do it: a Sketchnoting Case Study\nMy biggest roadblock when I started was “what do I even draw?” For me, the answer came from preparing for a conference. I knew I couldn’t capture every detail from every talk, so I needed a system. I skimmed the talk submissions, looked at the titles and abstracts, and made a list of the key concepts and model species that seemed most important. This manual process helped me build a targeted visual vocabulary before I even stepped into the room. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy notebook showing the practice sketches for the EMBO Conference. And a cappuccino.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose-up of my notebook, on the morning of the first day of the EMBO Conference. The page shows repeated icons of main concepts of the conference.\n\n\n\n\n\n As a case study for this blog post, I wanted to show you how to do it yourself with that same approach. For this occasion, I chose a topic I have no real knowledge, but always wanted to know more about: Urban Landscaping.\n\nStep 1: Scan for keywords\nFind an article or a short video on your chosen topic. For a conference, start from the program; for a series of lectures, you might have some PDF or documents beforehand. If you have nothing, a google search or the wikipedia page will do just fine.\nRead through it once, not to understand every detail, but to identify the most important, specific terms. Look for words that are:\n\nIn the title or headings.\nBolded or italicized.\nRepeated often.\nNouns that seem central to the concept.\n\nIf you are following along, here are the resources I used: How Urban Landscapes are saving you and the planet: 5 Benefits of Urban Landscape Architecture, and Urban Landscaping: Transforming City Spaces in 2024 Here are the concepts I wrote down:\n\nThis instantly gave me a list of the specific concepts I needed to focus on to start building my visual vocabulary.\n\n\nStep 2: Develop the icons\nOnce you have your list, it’s time to make your visual language. Remember, these are for you, so they don’t have to be perfect. The goal is simple, quick, and understandable.  Here’s what I came up with:\n\nAs you can see, I made some icons multiple times. Maybe I started with an idea, then I tried to draw it once or twice, and I realised if it was working or not, or if it was wasy to make, or if it was fast enough.  If a concept does not mean anything to you, or it does not spark any icon in your mind, feel free to google it!  For example, “biophilic design” was a completely new concept for me. I googled “biophilic design icon”, and I found some icons with a building and a leaf next to it, to symbolize the integration of botanical elements and urban items. If you check the lower part of the right page of my notebook, you can see that I started from a skyscraper with plants on the roof (too complex), then I tried a window (didn’t get the message through), then a house with a leaf (fast, simple).  Is it the best option? Probably not. But if I look at it, do I remember “biophilic design”? Yes!  That’s exactly the point of it! Maybe you might have a different idea, or you are faster at making a skyscraper. The key was to make each sketch meaningful to you, not to anyone else. This is where your brain takes over and the system comes to life.\n\n\nStep 3: Basic sketchnoting items\nBeyond content-specific icons, there is a universal visual language that goes beyond the topic being discussed. These can be, for example, arrows, basic shapes (circles, rectangles, cloud), and your own handwriting! I tried to summarise them like this:\n\nContainers: Use rectangles, circles, or clouds to group related ideas. For titles, use a banner or a larger, bolder font.\nConnectors: Lines, arrows, dots, dotte lines… all of those can show relationships, cause-and-effect, a sequence of steps, or maybe something yet to explore.\nTypography: Even tho I think you should not worry about perfect handwriting, you can play different letter sizes and styles to create a visual hierarchy. You can start small, for example with bold or all caps titles, and smaller body text.\n\n\n\nPutting it all together: your first sketchnote\nYou have your tools, your icons, and your grammar. Now what? You have to jump in and do it.\n\nChoose a short, simple piece of content. A 5-10 minute TED Talk, a short article, or a chapter of a book is perfect.\nListen or read for the main idea. Don’t try to capture every single word. Focus on key concepts and keywords.\nTranslate those keywords into your icons and add them to your page. Use your containers and connectors to structure the information as you go.\nDon’t worry about making it perfect! Your goal is to process the information, not to win an art contest. It will be messy. It will be imperfect. And that is exactly what makes it a useful learning tool. \n\nFor the purpose of this blogpost, I looked on youtube a very short talk about *Urban Landscaping, and I found this one. I made a fast digital sketchnote of what I heard, I discarded some information and I focused on what I thought important.\nHere’s the final piece!"

So which one is it? For me, it’s a bit of both.  The reality is that I, personally, do not use sketchnoting often. I do when I know I’m gonna be needing it. For the rest of the time (e.g. lab meetings, steering committee meetings, meetings with students) I am happy to take digital, or handwritten, notes. Since I do not practice sketchnoting often, I know that my sketchnoting muscle are not always trained. That’s why I practice this 3-steps preparation before the live event. By doing this, I know that the right icons will come to mind when I need it, because I practiced them. \nLet’s take back the “learning to write” example. You didn’t start by writing a story, but by practicing each letter of the alphabet until those symbols became second nature. You built a vocabulary of letters so that when it was time to write, you could focus on the ideas, not the individual shapes. \nBy doing the foundational work now, you are building a library of icons in your brain. This means that when a speaker at a conference says a key term, your hand will knows what to do. By doing it with topics you are familiar with, and often, and with enough practice, you’ll reach a point where you can do it live, and effortlessly, which frees you up to actively listen to the next idea."

The only common point is that it’s short.\nI read about microblogging the first time via a post on Bluesky. It was about something technical (R or Quarto, I can’t remember exactly), mostly a short “how to” guide. What struck me was how incredibly simple it looked. If all the instructions I need fit into 200 words or less, i thought, then it has to be doable. It also feels like a perfect way to share knowledge or thoughts without getting bogged down in preparation, or polish (or both)."

    "text": "What’s Inside\nIt includes:\n\nForum threads where people talk about how they actually use PKM tools in academia.\nBlog posts about real workflows; e.g. Zotero to Obsidian, or how to organize a literature review in Logseq.\nReady-to-use vaults and templates (some very polished, some simple but helpful).\nVideos and talks that show how people think through their own systems (these are one of my personal favourite. I could listen for hours to people on youtube telling me how they structure their academic knowledge).\nAcademic papers on knowledge graphs, note-taking, and scholarly PKM.\n\nI’ve grouped everything into categories, so it’s easy to browse or come back to later."

    "text": "Who This Is For\nThis might be useful if you:\n\nare writing a thesis (Bachelor, Master, Doctorate) and losing track of all your notes\nwant to stop reinventing your reading workflow every semester (been there, done that)\ntried using Obsidian or Logseq and didn’t know where to start\nfeel like your brain is full of articles you never quite remember at the right time\nyou have a to-read list that is longer than your 12yo Christmas wishlist\n\nBasically: if you’re a researcher trying to manage knowledge better, this list is for you."
