## A journey often starts with chaos and confusion 

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

At some point during my PhD, I started using Logseq to organize my knowledge. <br>
Then it was Obsidian, then both for a time. Then Logseq again. 
<br> Guess what? Now I am back to both.

Learning to use a note-taking app is an interesting experience. I mean, it's something you need to *manage* your knowledge, but you also need some time to *learn* how does that actually work. I guess if you already have a great note-taking routine (I hadn't), you know how to structure your thoughts (*carnival music roaming*) and you have some basic idea on how to connect your ideas (lucky you) then the learning curve is reasonable.

For me it was indeed interesting.  I downloaded Logseq with no ideas about how to make it work. 
My very first entry (*September 15th, 2021*) recites:

> I installed this thing. Not sure how it works (yet).  <br> 
>
> *cit. me as a confused Logseq first-timer*

Truer words have never been said. That was all for that week, no more entries. <br>
But then it was like a videogame. You keep thinking about it and you keep trying. <br> 
At some point you reach some level of certainty and move forward. <br>
Each new level brought its own set of complexities. The longer I used it, the more questions popped up: how do people structure their vaults? What‚Äôs a good way to handle academic reading? Is there a Zotero workflow that won‚Äôt break my brain?

If you are here because you'd like an answer to these questions, I apologize in advance. <br>
I do not think there is anything like this in the whole wide web. That's because it depends on you. When I [gave a workshop](https://github.com/cecibaldoni/PKM-workshop) to PhD students about note-taking apps and PKM I had a mantra (I think at some point I should have written it on a t-shirt, I was saying it every three or four sentences):

> What works for me might not work for you.  <br>
>
> *cit. me as a recalcitrant Logseq user*

I have my own workflow. I can show it to you and you can try it, but I bet you will find something about it that it's just *not right*. <br>
But then again, the internet if full of people finding their own workflow and sharing it with others (bless them).

That‚Äôs when I realized: I had quietly been collecting a pretty large pile of resources that other researchers (and future me!) might find useful.

It took a while to organize everything, but eventually I decided it was worth turning into a proper list.

## Disclaimer. 

There are already ‚Äúawesome PKM‚Äù lists out there, a quick github search will show you 5 others. And they are great.  <br>
But somehow some are pretty general, or focused on the tools, not the *context* in which people use them.

This list is my attempt at something more specific: a curated (and opinionated) resource library, with researchers and PhD students in mind.

## What‚Äôs Inside

It includes:

-   **Forum threads** where people talk about how they actually use PKM tools in *academia*.
-   **Blog posts** about *real* workflows; e.g. Zotero to Obsidian, or how to organize a literature review in Logseq.
-   **Ready-to-use vaults and templates** (some very polished, some simple but helpful).
-   **Videos and talks** that show how people think through their own systems (these are one of my personal favourite. I could listen for hours to people on youtube telling me how they structure their academic knowledge).
-   **Academic papers** on knowledge graphs, note-taking, and scholarly PKM.

I‚Äôve grouped everything into categories, so it‚Äôs easy to browse or come back to later.

## Who This Is For

This might be useful if you:

-   are writing a thesis (Bachelor, Master, Doctorate) and losing track of all your notes
-   want to stop reinventing your reading workflow every semester (*been there, done that*)
-   tried using Obsidian or Logseq and didn‚Äôt know where to start
-   feel like your brain is full of articles you never quite remember at the right time
-   you have a to-read list that is longer than your 12yo Christmas wishlist

Basically: if you‚Äôre a researcher trying to manage knowledge *better*, this list is for you.

## Want to Add Something?

Please do! I‚Äôd love to keep this evolving. You can:

-   [submit a pull request](https://github.com/cecibaldoni/awesome-PKM-for-academics/pulls)
-   open an [issue](https://github.com/cecibaldoni/awesome-PKM-for-academics/issues)
-   or just message me if you‚Äôre unsure how to do those and still have something you would like to add.

Tips, workflows, example vaults, tiny-but-useful plugins... anything that helps researchers use PKM more intentionally is welcome.

## TL;DR

I just wanted a place to put all the good stuff in, and maybe help a few other people skip the part where they re-Google ‚ÄúZotero to Obsidian academic workflow‚Äù every three weeks.
