Welcome to my website! <br><br>
I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour](https://www.ab.mpg.de/), in Konstanz, where I investigate how the environment and brain structures shape cognitive flexibility.<br><br>

In my free time I enjoy creating silly illustrations, comics and stickers! ðŸŽ¨<br><br>

Here you can find more about my research, talks, illustrations and contact details. <br><br> Explore the sections to learn more!
