I had something else in mind for this week (I guess that's a *future Ceci* problem).\n\nOn Tuesday, I saw a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7348925452993863680/) about a new R package called [`quartose`](https://quartose.djnavarro.net/), created by [Danielle Navarro](https://djnavarro.net/). Like everything with the word [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) in it, I was hooked, and after reading her [blogpost](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2025-07-05_quarto-syntax-from-r/) I thought: this looks like fun. \n\nDid I already say it was Tuesday? *wink wink, #TidyTuesday*.\n\nSo I took the opportunity to explore the dataset from this week’s challenge using `quartose`. I didn’t start with a specific analysis in mind, I just wanted to see how `quartose` felt in a real document.\n\n## Exploring the colour naming dataset with quartose\n\nThis week's [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main) features millions of responses from an online color naming game *slash* survey. It includes *a lot* of responses (*kudos to the curator of this dataset, [Nicola Rennie](https://github.com/nrennie)*), along with metadata about users (e.g. self-reported Y chromosome presence, colorblindness etc.).\n\nRather than focusing on the full dataset, I used a subset to play with structuring and presenting small summaries. The visualizations are extremely simple, but enough to test how different layout elements from `quartose` could help me guide the narrative.\n\nYou’ll see a few of these elements below:\n\n- Summary tables with side content\n- Tabs that organize plots by grouping\n- Notes placed outside the main column\n\nThe dataset is available in the [color project repo](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2025/2025-07-08), and the TidyTuesday project is a great excuse to learn something new each week (well, that's my excuse!).\n\n## Welcome to the color chaos\n\n\n\nThousands of people participated in a color-naming survey online. This document explores the funny and, sometimes, messy data behind the responses.\n\n### Who responded?\n\nLet’s begin with the basics: who were the users behind these color names?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover table-condensed\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<caption>User summary</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Total Users </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Monitor Types </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Users with Y </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Users without Y </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Colorblind Users </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Avg. Spam Probability </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 152401 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 103430 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 41464 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 5588 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0.222 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOver **150,000 individuals** took part in the experiment, each using one of a few different types of **monitors**. Of them, **more than 40,000** were not equipped with a Y chromosome. Over **5,000 individuals** indicated they were colorblind. One interesting variable in this dataset is a spam probability score, meaning (*I guess*) a numeric value that estimates how likely a given user was submitting low-quality answers.\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nquarto_div(content = c(paste0(\"Colorblind participants: \", users_summary$n_cb), \"<br>\",\n                       paste0(\"Average spam probability: \", round(users_summary$avg_spam_prob, 3)), \"<br>\",\n                       paste0(\"Monitor types: \", users_summary$n_monitors)),\n  class = \"column-margin\")\n```\n\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n\n Colorblind participants: 5588  <br>                           Average spam probability: 0.222<br>                           Monitor types: 3                \n\n:::\n\n \n\n### How much data?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  answers named_colors hex_codes\n    <int>        <int>     <int>\n1 1058211          949       949\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.column-margin .callout-tip}\n\n As you can see, this is a large dataset. People typed in thousands of color names for hundreds of distinct hex codes. That’s a lot of ways to say “blue.” \n\n:::\n\n \n\n### Answers per user\n\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n \n\n\n### Histogram\n\n \n![](quartose_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n\n### Average by Y chromosome\n\n \n![](quartose_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png){width=672}\n\n### Density\n\n \n![](quartose_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-3.png){width=672}\n\n::: \n\n \n\n**What you’re seeing:**  \n- The histogram shows that most users gave fewer than 10 answers, with a long tail of power users.  <br>\n- On average, answer counts per user are fairly similar across Y chromosome groups. <br>\n- The density plot shows the shape of participation, all groups are heavily skewed.\n\n\n### Colorblindness\n\nColor perception is often assumed to be universal, but of course, it isn’t. \n\nLet’s take a quick look at how many participants reported being colorblind:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusers |> \n  mutate(cb_status = factor(case_when(colorblind == 1 ~ \"Colorblind\",\n                                      colorblind == 0 ~ \"Not colorblind\",\n                                      TRUE ~ \"Unknown\"), levels = c(\"Not colorblind\", \"Colorblind\", \"Unknown\"))) |> \n  count(cb_status) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = cb_status, y = n, fill = cb_status)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Colorblindness Status\", y = \"Number of users\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Colorblindness status](quartose_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Spam Probability\n\nWhat kind of variation is there in users' spam scores? \n\nThis variable is a bit opaque... I don’t know exactly how it's computed. But it’s cool to see how it distributes across groups.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of spam scores](quartose_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of spam scores](quartose_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Is monitor type related?\n\nCould the type of monitor affect color perception or how people respond?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusers |> \n  mutate(monitor = fct_lump(monitor, n = 3)) |>\n  count(monitor) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = monitor, y = n, fill = monitor)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Monitor Type\", y = \"Number of users\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Monitor type vs number of users](quartose_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI admit, I had to google this. Most users had modern displays (LCD or Liquid Crystal Display), but there were still a few on older CRTs (Cathode Ray Tube, that really sounds like something from Back to the Future) or other types, which might influence how colors looked during the experiment.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere’s a lot more to explore. But I really liked the unexpected combinations and perspectives people bring when interpreting color.\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nquarto_div(content = \"Want to try your own analysis? Check out the full dataset at the TidyTuesday GitHub.\",\n           class = c(\"callout-tip\"))\n```\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\n Want to try your own analysis? Check out the full dataset at the TidyTuesday GitHub. \n\n:::\n\n \n\n## TL;DR\n\nTo me, `quartose` feels a bit like a lightweight take on scrollytelling. Not quite like `closeread`, which I [may have already talked about profusely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytKZ357Xtqw), but still an interesting way to shape an exploratory narrative. \n\nDoes it save me time compared to writing plain Quarto syntax? Not really. \n\nDo I want to try it again? Oh yes.\n\nI imagine it could be useful for workshop materials or blog tutorials, though I haven’t settled on how I might use it yet.\nAs Danielle wrote: \n\n>“All that `quarto_div()` actually does is construct syntax for the Quarto parser to capture and render.” \n\nThat’s exactly what it does. And for someone already used to Quarto’s logic, it feels like a natural extension.",
