Their solution? They **shrink**.\n\nUnlike animals that grow steadily over years, shrews undergo a radical transformation within a single lifetime. @cr-shrew-overlay\n\nThis dramatic change, **Dehnel’s Phenomenon**, reduces their brain, bones, and organs to save energy in winter scarcity, regrowing them in spring for breeding.\n\n:::{#cr-shrew}\n![](../img/shrew-original.png){alt=\"Close-up of a shrew\"}\n:::\n\n:::{#cr-shrew-overlay}\n![](../img/shrew-overlay.png){alt=\"Close-up of a shrew\"}\n:::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.cr-section layout=\"sidebar-right\"}\n\nHow does it work? @cr-shrew-cycle\n\nBorn in **summer**, shrews rapidly reach peak brain size. This is the largest their brains will ever be.  [@cr-shrew-cycle]{pan-to=\"50%,-20%\" scale-by=\"1.8\"}\n\nAs **winter** sets in, the shrew shrinks their brains and bodies, reducing energy needs. [@cr-shrew-cycle]{pan-to=\"-10%,-20%\" scale-by=\"2\"}\n\nBy **spring**, they double their winter mass, gearing up to reproduce. [@cr-shrew-cycle]{pan-to=\"-50%,-5%\" scale-by=\"1.7\"}\n\nShrews **live only about a year**, so this transformation happens just once.  @cr-shrew-cycle\n\n:::{#cr-shrew-cycle}\n![](../img/shrew-cycle.svg){alt=\"Shrew Cycle\"}\n:::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.cr-section layout=\"sidebar-right\"}\n\nWhat happens *cognitively* when brains shrink and regrow? @cr-shrew-cognitionbw\n\nMy research explores what happens when their brain changes size: @cr-shrew-cognition\n\nHow does brain size affect cognitive abilities? @cr-shrew-lightbulb\n\nDoes a smaller brain lead to simpler decision-making? @cr-shrew-decisionmaking\n\nThese questions go *beyond just shrews*. Understanding how an animal maintains function despite physical changes in the brain helps us explore broader ideas in **neurodegeneration** and **energy efficiency**.\n\n:::{#cr-shrew-cognitionbw}\n![](../img/shrew-cognitionbw.svg){alt=\"Shrew cognition\" width=\"70%\"}\n\n:::\n\n:::{#cr-shrew-cognition}\n![](../img/shrew-cognition.svg){alt=\"Shrew cognition\" width=\"70%\"}\n:::\n\n:::{#cr-shrew-lightbulb}\n![](../img/shrew-cognition-lightbulb.svg){alt=\"Shrew cognition\" width=\"70%\"}\n:::\n\n:::{#cr-shrew-decisionmaking}\n![](../img/shrew-cognition-complete.svg){alt=\"Shrew cognition\" width=\"70%\"}\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Does captivity influence learning? {#shrew-captivity}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n:::{.cr-section layout=\"sidebar-right\"}\n\nBrain size is of course only part of the story... environment shapes behavior too. @cr-captive-shrew\n\nIn *captivity*, animals face new challenges.  Do shrews kept in captivity learn differently than those in the wild? @cr-captive-shrew\n\nI tested the ability of shrews to associate an odor cue with a reward in a Y-maze **associative learning task**. @cr-shrew-empty-plot  \n\nEach **dot** represents an individual shrew's decision in a trial.  The **x-axis** represents the trial number, from 1 to 10. The **y-axis** shows whether they made the correct choice (**1**) or the wrong one (**0**). @cr-shrew-empty-plot  \n\n**Summer wild (orange)** shrews had the highest and earliest success rates. @cr-shrew-summer-plot\n\n**Winter wild (dark blue)** shrews showed a similar learning curve, but they learned at a slower rate and did not reach the **Summer** success rate. @cr-shrew-wild-plot\n\n**Winter captive (light blue)** shrews showed no learning, never deviating from chance. @cr-shrew-complete-plot\n\n📄 This work is published in *Royal Society Open Science*: [*Captivity alters behaviour but not seasonal brain size change in semi-naturally housed shrews*](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.242138)  \n\n:::{#cr-captive-shrew}\n![](../img/captive-shrew.jpg){alt=\"Shrew cognition\"}\n:::\n\n:::{#cr-shrew-empty-plot}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nIgnoring unknown labels:\n• fill : \"CI 95%\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](shrews_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n:::{#cr-shrew-summer-plot}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](shrews_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n:::{#cr-shrew-wild-plot}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](shrews_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n:::{#cr-shrew-complete-plot}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](shrews_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n### Project Collaborators {#collaborators}\n\nI conduct this research with [Dr. Dina Dechmann](https://www.ab.mpg.de/person/98231/2736) at the [Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour](https://www.ab.mpg.de/)\n\n<br> *Collaborators*: <br>\n[Prof. Dominik von Elverfeldt](https://www.uniklinik-freiburg.de/mr-en/team/elverfeldt.html), University of Freiburg, Germany <br>\n[Prof. Liliana Dávalos](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ecoevo/_people/_faculty_pages/davalos.php), Stony Brook University, New York <br>\n[Prof. John Nieland](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/133797), University of Aalborg, Denmark <br>\n",
