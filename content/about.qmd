> Scientific discovery is a social process: it depends as much on data as it does on the infrastructure used to share it.

My work exists at the intersection of research, technical infrastructure, and community leadership.

[My current work](shrews.qmd) centers on the cognitive compromises of the common shrew, a model species for studying brain size plasticity and behavior.

I lead community initiatives that transform Open Science from a policy requirement into a practical workflow. This involves building the technical systems and professional networks necessary for digital collaboration. I love **facilitating workshops** and I focus on making **complex ideas accessible** and **connecting people** across fields. You can see examples of this in my [Talks & Workshops](talks.qmd) and [Projects](project.qmd) pages.

Practicing [Open Science](open-science.qmd) is both a technical choice and a cultural one. I am committed to advancing transparency and reproducibility, ensuring data is not just "available" but actually usable.

Here are a few highlights of my community impact so far:

- Elected **representative** during my PhD and postdoc, giving voice to peers across departments
- Leading the **SORTEE code club** and helping run the **R-Ladies blog**, nurturing inclusive spaces for data science
- Part of The Turing Way’s community management working group, shaping best practices for open collaboration
- **Translator** for the Raspberry Pi Foundation and **code editor** for PCI Ecology; helping global audiences access science and coding content
- Workshop leader for **R programming** and **personal knowledge management**, demystifying tools to help others level up

I’m always curious about new ways to connect people and ideas.

If you want to collaborate, share ideas, or just have a friendly chat, feel free to [reach out](contact.qmd) or book some time to talk.
