    "text": "I am a behavioral ecologist, broadly interested in animal cognition and cognitive ecology.  My research focuses on how animals think, make decisions, and interact with their environment. I use quantitative methods to investigate the drivers and outcomes of cognition. I test animals, in their natural habitat or in captivity under semi-natural conditions, to uncover how these cognitive processes vary across species and contexts.  I have had the opportunity to work with a variety of species, including both birds and mammals, depending on the questions at hand. My current work centers on the cognitive compromises of the common shrew, a model species for studying Dehnel‚Äôs phenomenon‚Äîa remarkable seasonal adaptation that affects brain size and behavior in small mammals.  Recently, I became more involved in open science practices, and I aim to advance openness, transparency and reproducibility in my daily life as a researcher. I‚Äôve had the opportunity to participate to the Open Science Summer School organised by the Max Planck Digital Library and the LMU Open Science Center, where I learned practical tools and strategies to make research more accessible and collaborative. \nBefore becoming a scientist, I was a violinist, a journey that started when I was five. Over the years, I performed with various orchestras, including the United Europe Chamber Orchestra (UECO), and eventually, this work helped pay for my university studies.  While music has always been a passion, my drive to pursue science was even stronger, leading me to make the switch from professional musician to biology.  I still enjoy playing the violin for myself and appreciate the creativity and focus it brings to my life."

    "text": "Picture by Christian Ziegler  Organisms living in temperate climate must deal with seasonal changes in their environment, affecting food availability, plant cover and predation risk. Variable environments promote the expression of cognitive abilities such as exploration, memory and learning, resulting in larger and more complex brains. Additionally, animals have evolved a wide range of strategies (e.g.¬†food caching, migration, torpor, hibernation) to cope with unfavourable seasons, where food scarcity and low temperature can threaten their survival.\nThe common shrew, Sorex araneus, defies all rules. It does not migrate, and is unable to hibernate or use torpor, and due to the highest known mammalian metabolism has extremely fast fat turnover year-round. Instead, in autumn, this small mammal shrinks its skull, bones and major organs (including the brain) up to 20%, and subsequentially regrows them up to 16% in spring. While this helps them to deal with a decreased resource availability in winter the changes, especially in brain size, are likely to cause compromise.\nIn my PhD research, I explored the dynamics of brain plasticity in the common shrew through advanced imaging techniques and behavioral analysis.  I conducted this research supervised by Dr.¬†Dina Dechmann at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour\n\n\n Prof.¬†Dominik von Elverfeldt, University of Freiburg, Germany  Prof.¬†Liliana D√°valos, Stony Brook University, New York  Prof.¬†John Nieland, University of Aalborg, Denmark"

By making data, methods, and findings openly accessible, we strengthen the reliability of our work, accelerate scientific progress, and support a culture of transparency and trust. But starting from scratch in this landscape can feel overwhelming, with so many practices and tools to navigate. To keep myself focused and make open science work for me, I‚Äôve laid out a clear path forward‚Äîa set of commitments that feel meaningful to my research. By the end of 2025 I aim to have these practices fully integrated in my worflow. \n\nLearning Open Science Tools  \nTransparent Data Sharing \nPeer Collaboration and Community Building \nPre-registration or Open Preprint Publishing \nOpen-Access Publishing \nRoutine Data and Code Sharing \nRegistered Reports"
