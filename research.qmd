## The challenge of being small {#shrew}

:::{.cr-section layout="overlay-center"}

Shrews are some of the smallest mammals in the world, but they live fast-paced lives.  @cr-shrew

Unlike other small mammals, they donâ€™t hibernate or store food for winter. Instead, they burn through energy at an astonishing rate, requiring constant foraging just to survive. 
This high metabolism makes them particularly vulnerable to seasonal changes, and it makes it impossible for them to hibernate or use torpor. 

Their solution? They ***shrink.***

Unlike animals that grow steadily over years or those that adapt gradually across generations, shrews undergo a radical transformation within a single lifetime. @cr-shrew-overlay

As winter approaches, their skulls, brains, and even their bones, muscles, and internal organs ***shrink in size***

This process, known as **Dehnelâ€™s Phenomenon**, is an extreme form of biological restructuring that allows them to drastically lower their energy demands when food is scarce. Then, as spring arrives, their bodies begin to regrow, reversing much of the shrinkage in preparation for a season of rapid activity and reproduction.

How does it work? @cr-shrew-cycle

Shrews are born in **summer**, growing rapidly and reaching their lifetime peak in brain size within just a few months. This is the largest their brains will ever be.  [@cr-shrew-cycle]{pan-to="50%,0%" scale-by="2"}

As **winter** sets in, something remarkable happens: their skulls begin to shrink, their brains lose mass, and their bodies become smaller and leaner. These changes reduce their energy consumption at a time when survival depends on making the most of limited resources. [@cr-shrew-cycle]{pan-to="-10%,0%" scale-by="2"}

Then, with the arrival of **spring**, their bodies regrow some (but not all) of what was lost. Their **body mass grows to twice its winter size by spring**. This allows them to take advantage of renewed food availability and prepare for reproduction. [@cr-shrew-cycle]{pan-to="-50%,0%" scale-by="2"}

Shrews **live only about a year**, so this transformation happens just once in their lifetime.  @cr-shrew-cycle

What does the brain shrinkage and regrowth mean for **how shrews think, learn and behave**? @cr-shrew-cognitionbw

The idea that a brain can physically shrink and then regrow challenges many assumptions about cognition, memory, and plasticity.

My research explores what happens when their brain changes size: @cr-shrew-cognition

How does brain size affect cognitive abilities? @cr-shrew-lightbulb

Does a smaller brain lead to simpler, more instinct-driven decision-making? @cr-shrew-decisionmaking

When the brain changes, does function fully return, or does it reorganize in new ways?

These questions go beyond just shrews. Understanding how an animal maintains function despite physical changes in the brain helps us explore broader ideas in **neurodegeneration** and **energy efficiency**. 
By studying them, I can ask: What are the true limits of a flexible brain?
