You can see examples of this in my Talks & Workshops and Projects pages.\nI am deeply involved in open science practices, and I aim to advance openness, transparency and reproducibility in my daily life as a researcher. I believe openness is both a technical choice and cultural one, about how we share knowledge and invite others to build on it.\n\n\n Before becoming a scientist, I was a violinist, a journey that started when I was five. Over the years, I performed with various orchestras, including the United Europe Chamber Orchestra (UECO), and eventually, this work helped pay for my university studies.  While music has always been a passion, science turned out to be an even stronger driver, leading me to make the switch from professional musician to biologist.  I still enjoy playing the violin for myself and appreciate the creativity and focus it brings to my life."

    "section": "",
    "text": "What do we actually mean when we say something is reproducible? Or replicable? Or reliable? These words come up all the time, especially when you are reading about open science or trying to make your research more transparent. They sound straightforward, but we do not always use them the same way, even when we think we do.\nA few months ago, while preparing a talk on open science (you can find the presentation here), I ran into a familiar tangle. I had reached the part about the four Rs, and, as usual, things were a bit muddled. I did what I often do when something does not quite make sense: I made a visual. In this case, I wanted to map out reliable, repeatable, reproducible, and replicable, the way I had learned them. It was not meant to be a final word on anything. I just needed a clearer picture for myself.\n\nIn the infographic, I defined them like this:\n\nReliable: when you use the same data and the same analyses and you get the same results\n\nRepeatable: when you use new data but the same analysis and you get the same results\n\nReplicable: when someone else uses new data and the same analysis and they get the same results\n\nReproducible: when someone else uses the same data and the same analyses and they get the same results\n\nIn other words, these terms all ask a similar question: if we try the same process again, either with the same ingredients or some new ones, do we get the same outcome? The differences lie in who is doing the work, what data they are using, and whether the analysis method stays the same.\n\n\n\nA few weeks later, I attended a great workshop hosted by SORTEE, the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolution. It focused on reproducible data analysis in R, and after the main talk, someone posted a question in the community Slack: what exactly is the difference between reproducible and reliable?\nI thought it was a simple follow-up question, something we would all agree on quickly. Several people responded. But as the conversation went on, it became clear we were not saying quite the same thing. Each of us had a slightly different take on what the terms meant, and none of us were strangers to the topic.\nIt turns out that agreeing on being rigorous is easier than agreeing on what the words mean.\n\n\n\nSo, who was right in that thread? It turns out, it depends who you ask.\nAfter looking into it more carefully, I realised that the same two terms, reproducibility and replicability, are used across many fields, but people do not always mean the same thing by them. That is not just a quirk, it actually reflects the kinds of questions different disciplines are used to asking.\nIf you are working in computational science, like data science or software development, reproducibility usually means re-running someone else’s code with the same data and getting the same output. It is about whether your pipeline works and whether it can be used again by someone else. Replicability, on the other hand, is when someone collects new data, applies the same method, and gets similar results. The focus here is often on reproducible code, documented workflows, and consistent environments.\nIn psychology or the life sciences, things look a bit different. Reproducibility tends to mean reanalyzing the same dataset and seeing if you come to the same statistical conclusions. Replicability usually means repeating the study with new participants, or samples, or data, and checking whether the same effect appears again. The focus is less on rerunning code and more on checking whether findings hold up when repeated.\nIn the social sciences, there is even more variation. Replicability often includes testing whether a finding holds in a new context, such as a different population, setting, or time. Reproducibility still involves using the same data and methods, but with more emphasis on sharing not just data, but also things like surveys, instruments, and procedures. The big question here is whether the result still holds when we move it somewhere else.\nThe National Academies of Sciences tried to create a shared baseline across disciplines in their 2019 report. Their definitions are:\n- Reproducibility is getting the same results using the same data and the same analysis\n- Replicability is getting consistent results when a study is repeated with new data and the same methods\nThe Turing Way, an open-source community guide to reproducible, ethical, and collaborative data science, stays close to the computational science view. It defines reproducibility as obtaining the same results when the same analysis steps are performed on the same dataset, and replicability as obtaining qualitatively similar results when the same analysis is applied to a different dataset.\n\nNote: to be fair, The Turing Way also introduces additional concepts like robustness and generalisability, but I will not go into those here, or I will lose the thin thread of my thought. If you are interested in following up, read them here!\nSo while the words are shared, the meaning behind them shifts depending on the field. Sometimes the question is whether something runs again. Sometimes it is whether it works again. And sometimes it is whether it still matters in a new setting.\nThat is where most of the confusion starts. And, in a way, that is also where the interesting conversations begin.\n\n\n\nDo I still like it? Yes. It helped me understand the conceptual space, and it got a useful conversation going. In some fields, the definitions I used match common usage. In others, they might not. And that is okay. For what it is worth, my version is very close to how the National Academies of Sciences define the terms. But context always matters more than labels.\nWhat I have learned is that it is less important to be right than to recognise that the definitions vary. If you are using one of these terms, define it, even briefly. This can go a long way in avoiding misunderstandings, especially when you are working across disciplines.\n\n\n\nThis whole experience, making a diagram, joining a discussion, watching it unravel slightly, and learning from the mess, left me with a few reflections:\n\nDefinitions are not set in stone. They evolve, and that is something open science helps us see more clearly. When we work in transparent, collaborative ways, we start noticing the gaps and overlaps in how we talk about things. Where you are, what you are working on, and who you are working with can all shape what these terms mean to you\n\nWhen you use a term like reproducible or replicable, take a second to say what you mean by it\n\nVisuals can be powerful tools for thinking and communicating, even if they do not capture every nuance\n\nIf you are confused by these terms, you are not alone. I gave a whole talk on the topic and still walked away with more questions than answers, but also a clearer sense of what to ask next. That feels like progress to me\n\n\n\n\nI made an infographic.\nI joined a discussion.\nThe discussion got a bit messy.\nI learned a lot.\nOpen science is not about always getting things right the first time. It is about being transparent enough to revise your thinking, share what you have learned, and leave room for nuance and complexity. This post is part of that process.\nFor now, I will leave the diagram as it is. Maybe I will revise it later. Either way, I hope it gets people thinking, and talking."

    "text": "“We Need Clay!” (or: my citations are always messed up)\nYou know how Sherlock Holmes said, “Data! Data! Data! I can’t make bricks without clay”?\nWell, I didn’t. I had to google it because my brain had somewhat summarized it in “I need clay!”, which didn’t make much sense when I wrote it down. I blame my internal Italian-to-English translator, and the fact that if I don’t write things down, they do not stick in my brain.\nEither way, as a good scientist, I knew I needed raw material. My own daily activities would be my clay.\nI decided to stick with Logseq for many reasons. First of all, I love Logseq. Secondly, I spent years building a routine of note-taking, so I could just add an additional step. Logseq was the hub for my PhD research, it is where I plan these blogpost, my work tasks and anything important in my life. But one thing is to write things down and another one is to read them again and do something with them (more on this topic coming soon, stay tuned for Part 2 on this note-taking blogpost series).\nWhen I started this “project” i had a very loose plan. The first important rule was to have a consistent structure to put all the entries together. I chose the tag #SelfReflection (mostly because #journaling was already taken for other things).\nIn the project page, I tried to summarize the plan it in few bullet points:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhases\n\n\n\n\nData collection: I need data to work with. Record the tasks or activities done throughout the week and write down how I feel about them, but also if I feel skilled at them or not.\n\nMandatory: Write down small and specific tasks. For example, instead of “wrote article” say “wrote 200-word paragraph about the function of AQP4”\n\nReview: After the week is over, check the entries in Logseq for recurrent patterns. For example, things that weren’t real tasks, but did them because I wanted to, needed to, or enjoyed it.\nCreate keywords from the data: Having specific tasks I enjoy/am good at, I can now extract skills.\n\nE.g., “I like explaining concepts visually” → “Visual Communication, Science Communication”\nE.g., “I enjoy breaking down complex topics” → “Content Structuring, Information Design”\nE.g., “I love to create systems for organizing data” → “Knowledge Management”\n\nRinse and repeat\n\n\n\nAs you can see, my initial system was quite simple. And, as you might have noticed, I already left you with a spoiler: after a few weeks I edited the first point to remind myself that too broad tasks were not the point. But that’s the good thing about trying a system, you can always improve it!\nFor Version 1.0 I created a template that I could call anywhere in my notes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n\n\n\n#SelfReflection\n\nTask:\nFeeling:\nEnjoyment:\nSkill Level:\n\n\n\n\nTo make this a real habit, I embedded this empty structure directly into my daily notes template in Logseq. Every morning as I was opening Logseq, it was there.\nI won’t lie, the beginning was extremely difficult. I’m sure I’m not alone in this: you finish your workday, you’re mentally exhausted, but you cannot recollect what you actually did. It’s like meditation; everyone sucks at it at the beginning. But with practice, the process became easier, and I got better at acknowledging the small tasks: “Today I wrote a difficult email, I felt super good about it, even if I wasn’t feeling very skilled.” Done. One data point.\nFor a while, this worked. Then, a new kind of excitement took hold. I wasn’t just journaling anymore; I was building a dataset.\nMindblowing sound.\nAnd if you have a dataset… you have to plot it. I think it’s a law somewhere, look it up.\nThis decision to move my notes into R for analysis was the turning point that exposed every flaw in my simple little system."

    "text": "The Roadblocks in R\nAfter a few months, I had a reasonable amount of data and was ready to make the jump to R. To make this journey reproducible for you, I’ll use a small, fake dataset that perfectly mirrors the structure of my real data (for the whole workflow, check the last section!):\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# A reproducible example of the data (after extraction)\n# this mimics what the parsing script would produce\n\nfake_reflections &lt;- tibble::tribble(~task, ~feeling_score, ~enjoyment, ~skill,\n                                    \"Wrote a difficult email\", 5, 4, 6,\n                                    \"Gave Tidyverse workshop\", 7, 9, 10,\n                                    \"Debugged failing script\", 4, 8, 9,\n                                    \"Organized project files\", 6, 7, 8)\n\nThe first problem was immediately obvious. I should have seen this coming. My Task descriptions were unique and messy, with no repeatable patterns: great for a human reader but useless for aggregation.\nThis led to the first iteration: creating a Tag field for consistent taxonomy for my work.\nThis meant exactly what you are thinking: going back to all my entries and add meaningful tags.\nYuppi, she said sarcastically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2.0\n\n\n\n\n#SelfReflection\n\nTask:\nFeeling:\nEnjoyment:\nSkill Level:\nTag:\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n# Same fake data, but with tag as well\n\nfake_reflections &lt;- tibble::tribble(~task, ~feeling_score, ~enjoyment, ~skill, ~tag, \n                                    \"Wrote a difficult email\", 5, 4, 6, \"writing\", \n                                    \"Gave Tidyverse workshop\", 7, 9, 10, \"presentation; mentoring\",\n                                    \"Debugged failing script\", 4, 8, 9, \"coding\", \n                                    \"Organized project files\", 6, 7, 8, \"organisation; project management\")\n\nNice! Now I can extract the information and plot it!\n\nfake_reflections &lt;- fake_reflections %&gt;%\n  separate_rows(tag, sep = \"\\\\s*;\\\\s*\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(tag = str_to_title(tag))\n\nggplot(fake_reflections, aes(x = skill, y = enjoyment, color = tag)) +\n  geom_jitter(size=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh. Wait a minute.\n\nstr(fake_reflections)\n\ntibble [6 × 5] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ task         : chr [1:6] \"Wrote a difficult email\" \"Gave Tidyverse workshop\" \"Gave Tidyverse workshop\" \"Debugged failing script\" ...\n $ feeling_score: num [1:6] 5 7 7 4 6 6\n $ enjoyment    : num [1:6] 4 9 9 8 7 7\n $ skill        : num [1:6] 6 10 10 9 8 8\n $ tag          : chr [1:6] \"Writing\" \"Presentation\" \"Mentoring\" \"Coding\" ...\n\n\nI had duplicate entries in my tibble! How?\nWell, better data wrangling people would know already, but it took me a minute to discover the “problem” (if we want to call it problem).\nI used multiple tags per task, thinking it would best capture my experience. If I am giving a workshop, it’s both “Mentoring” and “Presentation”, why choose? It is different than, for example, giving a presentation to a lab meeting. Mentoring could also be other things, like helping a student prepare with their application or interview. I was pretty happy with my recordings.\nBut when you run separate_rows(tag, sep = \"\\s*;\\s*\"), for every row with multiple tags (e.g. “Mentoring” and “Presentation”), it creates a new row per tag, duplicating all the other fields (task, feeling, etc.) for each tag. So, if a task has two tags, you get two rows (one for each tag, but all fields except tag are exactly duplicated). For three tags, three rows. For one tag, no duplication.\nAargh. What now? some entries, like the Gave Tidyverse workshop, were now duplicated, skewing my data. My clever system was an analytical headache. That real-world problem forced me back to the drawing board to weigh the trade-off between keeping this system (it’s not that bad) or clarity.\nI considered a few options:\n\nKeep the multiple tags and duplicated rows.\nForce myself to choose only one primary tag per task.\nIf a task truly had multiple facets, break it into smaller, single-tag tasks.\nAdd a Tag2 field for secondary tags.\n\nI can see the pro and cons for all options. I wondered about what to do. The reason why I wrote it all here it’s because, ultimately, the best option for me could not be the best option for someone else. This is the beauty of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM): “what works for me might not work for you”.\nThe key is to find a system that serves your analytical goals. Do you mind the multiple rows? Maybe not. I can see a use of it: for example if you want to see which Tags are often paired together, and if they are often associated with high enjoyment score.\nBut I am not so interested in that, so I chose option 3. It forced me to be more specific about what I was actually doing. If I couldn’t choose a single tag, the task was probably too big anyway."

    "text": "Defining what matters\nWith my tagging system refined, I was ready. But then I hit my nth roadblock, and I realized I wasn’t.\nNamely, I looked back at my data and realized I was using Feeling and Enjoyment interchangeably. That is not a good sign. There was a reason I created two fields, but what was that again? And why didn’t I write it down?\nI had to pause and create distinct definitions for myself:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFeeling: What was my emotional state during or just after the task? This is about the immediate mood (e.g. energized, frustrated, proud, anxious). It can be influenced by deadlines or context.\nEnjoyment: Did I actually like the task itself? e.g. you can feel accomplished after a task you found profoundly boring.\n\n\nHere’s how the (my) distinction plays out:\n\nYou might feel stressed while troubleshooting code (Feeling: “anxious, challenged”), but deeply enjoy the problem-solving (Enjoyment: 8/10).\nYou might feel calm while doing mundane admin work (Feeling: “relaxed”), but find it intensely boring (Enjoyment: 2/10).\n\nThis clarification fundamentally improved my data. I started noticing tasks where my Feeling was low but Enjoyment was high. For example, I often felt anxious before a presentation (Feeling score: 3/10), but I consistently rated my Enjoyment of the act of presenting as very high (9/10). This simple distinction revealed that some of the activities that are most rewarding for me are also the ones that push me out of my comfort zone. In this case, I maintained Feeling as a numerical score, but I introduced a categorical tag alongside it:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nfake_reflections &lt;- tibble::tribble(~task, ~feeling_score, ~feeling_text, ~enjoyment, ~skill, ~tag,\n                                    \"Wrote a difficult email\",  5, \"focused\", 4, 6, \"writing\",\n                                    \"Gave Tidyverse workshop\",  3, \"anxious\", 9, 10, \"presentation\",\n                                    \"Debugged failing script\",  4, \"challenged\", 8, 9, \"coding\",\n                                    \"Organized project files\",  7, \"productive\", 7, 8, \"project management\")\n\nThis is still a working system. I am not sure yet what do I want to prioritize: the numerical score or the categorical tag, or perhaps find a way to integrate both. I need more data collection before making a decision. But ehi, that’s exactly what I love about taking notes! It’s like this system that’s always growing and getting better as I figure things out more about my own experiences."

This journey gave me a powerful quantitative map of my skills and passions.\nBut what about the stories hidden in the unstructured text of my daily notes? What themes and patterns emerge when I’m not scoring and tagging, but just writing?\nThat’s a story for another time. In Part 2, we’ll leave the numbers behind and venture into the world of text mining to see what other secrets my Logseq vault is waiting to tell me."

Do shrews kept in captivity learn differently than those in the wild?\n\n\n\n\nI tested the ability of shrews to associate an odor cue with a reward in a Y-maze associative learning task.\n\n\n\n\nEach dot represents an individual shrew’s decision in a trial. The x-axis represents the trial number, from 1 to 10. The y-axis shows whether they made the correct choice (1) or the wrong one (0).\n\n\n\n\nSummer wild (orange) shrews had the highest and earliest success rates.\n\n\n\n\nWinter wild (dark blue) shrews showed a similar learning curve, but they learned at a slower rate and did not reach the Summer success rate.\n\n\n\n\nWinter captive (light blue) shrews showed no learning, never deviating from chance.\n\n\n\n\n📄 This work is published in Royal Society Open Science: Captivity alters behaviour but not seasonal brain size change in semi-naturally housed shrews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Collaborators\nI conduct this research supervised by Dr. Dina Dechmann at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour\n Collaborators:  Prof. Dominik von Elverfeldt, University of Freiburg, Germany  Prof. Liliana Dávalos, Stony Brook University, New York  Prof. John Nieland, University of Aalborg, Denmark"

    "text": "Welcome to the color chaos\nThousands of people participated in a color-naming survey online. This document explores the funny and, sometimes, messy data behind the responses.\n\nWho responded?\nLet’s begin with the basics: who were the users behind these color names?\n\n\n\nUser summary\n\n\nTotal Users\nMonitor Types\nUsers with Y\nUsers without Y\nColorblind Users\nAvg. Spam Probability\n\n\n\n\n152401\n3\n103430\n41464\n5588\n0.222\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 150,000 individuals took part in the experiment, each using one of a few different types of monitors. Of them, more than 40,000 were not equipped with a Y chromosome. Over 5,000 individuals indicated they were colorblind. One interesting variable in this dataset is a spam probability score, meaning (I guess) a numeric value that estimates how likely a given user was submitting low-quality answers.\nquarto_div(content = c(paste0(\"Colorblind participants: \", users_summary$n_cb), \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                       paste0(\"Average spam probability: \", round(users_summary$avg_spam_prob, 3)), \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                       paste0(\"Monitor types: \", users_summary$n_monitors)),\n  class = \"column-margin\")\n\n\nColorblind participants: 5588  Average spam probability: 0.222 Monitor types: 3\n\n\nHow much data?\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  answers named_colors hex_codes\n    &lt;int&gt;        &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 1058211          949       949\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this is a large dataset. People typed in thousands of color names for hundreds of distinct hex codes. That’s a lot of ways to say “blue.”\n\n\n\nAnswers per user\n\nHistogramAverage by Y chromosomeDensity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you’re seeing:\n- The histogram shows that most users gave fewer than 10 answers, with a long tail of power users.  - On average, answer counts per user are fairly similar across Y chromosome groups.  - The density plot shows the shape of participation, all groups are heavily skewed.\n\n\nColorblindness\nColor perception is often assumed to be universal, but of course, it isn’t.\nLet’s take a quick look at how many participants reported being colorblind:\n\nusers |&gt; \n  mutate(cb_status = factor(case_when(colorblind == 1 ~ \"Colorblind\",\n                                      colorblind == 0 ~ \"Not colorblind\",\n                                      TRUE ~ \"Unknown\"), levels = c(\"Not colorblind\", \"Colorblind\", \"Unknown\"))) |&gt; \n  count(cb_status) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = cb_status, y = n, fill = cb_status)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Colorblindness Status\", y = \"Number of users\")\n\n\n\n\nColorblindness status\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpam Probability\nWhat kind of variation is there in users’ spam scores?\nThis variable is a bit opaque… I don’t know exactly how it’s computed. But it’s cool to see how it distributes across groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of spam scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of spam scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs monitor type related?\nCould the type of monitor affect color perception or how people respond?\n\nusers |&gt; \n  mutate(monitor = fct_lump(monitor, n = 3)) |&gt;\n  count(monitor) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = monitor, y = n, fill = monitor)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Monitor Type\", y = \"Number of users\")\n\n\n\n\nMonitor type vs number of users\n\n\n\n\nI admit, I had to google this. Most users had modern displays (LCD or Liquid Crystal Display), but there were still a few on older CRTs (Cathode Ray Tube, that really sounds like something from Back to the Future) or other types, which might influence how colors looked during the experiment.\n\n\nConclusion\nThere’s a lot more to explore. But I really liked the unexpected combinations and perspectives people bring when interpreting color.\nquarto_div(content = \"Want to try your own analysis? Check out the full dataset at the TidyTuesday GitHub.\",\n           class = c(\"callout-tip\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWant to try your own analysis?

    "text": "TL;DR\nTo me, quartose feels a bit like a lightweight take on scrollytelling. Not quite like closeread, which I may have already talked about profusely, but still an interesting way to shape an exploratory narrative.\nDoes it save me time compared to writing plain Quarto syntax? Not really.\nDo I want to try it again? Oh yes.\nI imagine it could be useful for workshop materials or blog tutorials, though I haven’t settled on how I might use it yet. As Danielle wrote:\n\n“All that quarto_div() actually does is construct syntax for the Quarto parser to capture and render.”\n\nThat’s exactly what it does. And for someone already used to Quarto’s logic, it feels like a natural extension."

I mean, it’s something you need to manage your knowledge, but you also need some time to learn how does that actually work. I guess if you already have a great note-taking routine (I hadn’t), you know how to structure your thoughts (carnival music roaming) and you have some basic idea on how to connect your ideas (lucky you) then the learning curve is reasonable.\nFor me it was indeed interesting. I downloaded Logseq with no ideas about how to make it work. My very first entry (September 15th, 2021) recites:\n\nI installed this thing. Not sure how it works (yet). \ncit. me as a confused Logseq first-timer\n\nTruer words have never been said. That was all for that week, no more entries.  But then it was like a videogame. You keep thinking about it and you keep trying.  At some point you reach some level of certainty and move forward.  Each new level brought its own set of complexities. The longer I used it, the more questions popped up: how do people structure their vaults? What’s a good way to handle academic reading? Is there a Zotero workflow that won’t break my brain?\nIf you are here because you’d like an answer to these questions, I apologize in advance.  I do not think there is anything like this in the whole wide web. That’s because it depends on you. When I gave a workshop to PhD students about note-taking apps and PKM I had a mantra (I think at some point I should have written it on a t-shirt, I was saying it every three or four sentences):\n\nWhat works for me might not work for you. \ncit. me as a recalcitrant Logseq user\n\nI have my own workflow. I can show it to you and you can try it, but I bet you will find something about it that it’s just not right.  But then again, the internet if full of people finding their own workflow and sharing it with others (bless them).\nThat’s when I realized: I had quietly been collecting a pretty large pile of resources that other researchers (and future me!) might find useful.\nIt took a while to organize everything, but eventually I decided it was worth turning into a proper list.\n👉 Awesome PKM for Academics and Researchers"

I guess if you already have a great note-taking routine (I hadn’t), you know how to structure your thoughts (carnival music roaming) and you have some basic idea on how to connect your ideas (lucky you) then the learning curve is reasonable.\nFor me it was indeed interesting. I downloaded Logseq with no ideas about how to make it work. My very first entry (September 15th, 2021) recites:\n\nI installed this thing. Not sure how it works (yet). \ncit. me as a confused Logseq first-timer\n\nTruer words have never been said. That was all for that week, no more entries.  But then it was like a videogame. You keep thinking about it and you keep trying.  At some point you reach some level of certainty and move forward.  Each new level brought its own set of complexities. The longer I used it, the more questions popped up: how do people structure their vaults? What’s a good way to handle academic reading? Is there a Zotero workflow that won’t break my brain?\nIf you are here because you’d like an answer to these questions, I apologize in advance.  I do not think there is anything like this in the whole wide web. That’s because it depends on you. When I gave a workshop to PhD students about note-taking apps and PKM I had a mantra (I think at some point I should have written it on a t-shirt, I was saying it every three or four sentences):\n\nWhat works for me might not work for you. \ncit. me as a recalcitrant Logseq user\n\nI have my own workflow. I can show it to you and you can try it, but I bet you will find something about it that it’s just not right.  But then again, the internet if full of people finding their own workflow and sharing it with others (bless them).\nThat’s when I realized: I had quietly been collecting a pretty large pile of resources that other researchers (and future me!) might find useful.\nIt took a while to organize everything, but eventually I decided it was worth turning into a proper list.\n👉 Awesome PKM for Academics and Researchers"

I could listen for hours to people on youtube telling me how they structure their academic knowledge).\nAcademic papers on knowledge graphs, note-taking, and scholarly PKM.\n\nI’ve grouped everything into categories, so it’s easy to browse or come back to later."

My contributions to open science span different levels, from personal practices to community involvement and infrastructure.   I see open science as a way of working, not just a set of rules. It affects how I design studies, write code, share results, and support others in doing the same.  \n\nWhat I share\nI make my data, analysis scripts, and visualizations publicly available whenever possible. Here is a list of resources where you can find my data and code: \n\nGitHub: my profile and open repositories, it includes some presentations for talks and workshops I organised.  → See Workshop and Talks for more! \nOSF - Open Science Framework: my profile and materials from ongoing or not-yet-published projects. \nEdmond – Max Planck Society Repository: in here you can find my data and scripts associated with peer-reviewed articles. \n\n\n\nCommunity & Initiatives\nOpen science also means supporting the systems and communities that make it possible. I contribute through organizing, reviewing, and community-building:\n\nI am an Open Science Ambassador in the Max Planck Society, helping build local awareness and promote transparent research practices across the Max Planck Institutes.\nI am an active member of SORTEE (Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolution), where I serve on the Member Engagement Committee.\nIn 2025, I am organising the SORTEE Code Club, a monthly online meetup exploring practical tools and workflows for open science.\n→ See the upcoming schedule here.\nI also work as a Data Editor for PCI Ecology, where I check the accessibility and reproducibility of data and code associated with recommended preprints."
