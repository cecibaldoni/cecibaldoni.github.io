## Research {#current-research}

My work focuses on how small mammals adapt to a fast-changing world ‚Äî especially how their brains and behavior respond to environmental pressures.

I‚Äôm particularly interested in seasonal brain plasticity, environmental adaptations and their cumulative effects on cognitive flexibility. Much of this work revolves around a unique little animal: the common shrew.

**Explore how the common shrew copes with winter by shrinking and regrowing its brain, and what this teaches us about brain plasticity and cognition!**

## Open Science {#open-science}

Open science is about building a scientific culture that values accessibility, transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration.

This is something I care about deeply and try to reflect in my daily work. <br> My contributions to open science span different levels, from personal practices to community involvement and infrastructure.  <br> <br>
I see open science as a way of working, not just a set of rules. It affects how I design studies, write code, share results, and support others in doing the same. <br> <br>

I make my data, analysis scripts, and visualizations publicly available whenever possible. <br><br>Here is a list of resources where you can find my data and code: <br><br>

- [GitHub](https://github.com/cecibaldoni?tab=repositories): my profile and open repositories, it includes some presentations for talks and workshops I organised. See [Talks & Workshop](#talks-workshops) for more! <br>
- [OSF - Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/jdxn2/): my profile and materials from ongoing or not-yet-published projects. <br>
- [Edmond ‚Äì Max Planck Society Repository](https://edmond.mpg.de/dataverse/edmond/?q=%22Baldoni%2C+Cecilia%22): in here you can find my data and scripts associated with peer-reviewed articles. <br>

### OS Community & Initiatives

- I am an **Open Science Ambassador** in the [Max Planck Society](https://www.openscience-groups.mpg.de/ambassadors), helping build local awareness and promote transparent research practices across the Max Planck Institutes.
- I am an active member of [SORTEE](https://www.sortee.org/) ‚Äî the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolution ‚Äî where I serve on the **Member Engagement Committee**.
- In 2025, I am organising the [SORTEE Code Club](https://www.sortee.org/code_club/), a monthly online meetup exploring practical tools and workflows for open science.  
  ‚Üí You can find the list of events I'm currently organising [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rOOOE7ghPduwtFftG0DJJf0DXVigAdcmQ0xdEwbKQXo/edit).

- I also work as a **Data Editor** for [PCI Ecology](https://ecology.peercommunityin.org/), where I check the accessibility and reproducibility of data and code associated with recommended preprints.
