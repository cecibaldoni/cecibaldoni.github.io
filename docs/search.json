    "text": "Shrews are some of the smallest mammals in the world, but they live fast-paced lives.\n\n\n\n\nUnlike other small mammals, they don’t hibernate or store food for winter. Instead, they burn through energy at an astonishing rate, requiring constant foraging just to survive. This high metabolism makes them particularly vulnerable to seasonal changes, and it makes it impossible for them to hibernate or use torpor.\n\n\n\n\nTheir solution? They shrink.\n\n\n\n\nUnlike animals that grow steadily over years or those that adapt gradually across generations, shrews undergo a radical transformation within a single lifetime.\n\n\n\n\nAs winter approaches, their skulls, brains, and even their bones, muscles, and internal organs shrink in size\n\n\n\n\nThis process, known as Dehnel’s Phenomenon, is an extreme form of biological restructuring that allows them to drastically lower their energy demands when food is scarce. Then, as spring arrives, their bodies begin to regrow, reversing much of the shrinkage in preparation for a season of rapid activity and reproduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n\n\n\nShrews are born in summer, growing rapidly and reaching their lifetime peak in brain size within just a few months. This is the largest their brains will ever be.\n\n\n\n\nAs winter sets in, something remarkable happens: their skulls begin to shrink, their brains lose mass, and their bodies become smaller and leaner. These changes reduce their energy consumption at a time when survival depends on making the most of limited resources.\n\n\n\n\nThen, with the arrival of spring, their bodies regrow some (but not all) of what was lost. Their body mass grows to twice its winter size by spring. This allows them to take advantage of renewed food availability and prepare for reproduction.\n\n\n\n\nShrews live only about a year, so this transformation happens just once in their lifetime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the brain shrinkage and regrowth mean for how shrews think, learn and behave?\n\n\n\n\nThe idea that a brain can physically shrink and then regrow challenges many assumptions about cognition, memory, and plasticity.\n\n\n\n\nMy research explores what happens when their brain changes size:\n\n\n\n\nHow does brain size affect cognitive abilities?\n\n\n\n\nDoes a smaller brain lead to simpler, more instinct-driven decision-making?\n\n\n\n\nWhen the brain changes, does function fully return, or does it reorganize in new ways?\n\n\n\n\nThese questions go beyond just shrews. Understanding how an animal maintains function despite physical changes in the brain helps us explore broader ideas in neurodegeneration and energy efficiency. By studying them, I can ask: What are the true limits of a flexible brain?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI conduct this research supervised by Dr. Dina Dechmann at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour  Collaborators:  Prof. Dominik von Elverfeldt, University of Freiburg, Germany  Prof. Liliana Dávalos, Stony Brook University, New York  Prof. John Nieland, University of Aalborg, Denmark"

    "text": "I am a behavioral ecologist, broadly interested in animal cognition and cognitive ecology.  My research focuses on how animals think, make decisions, and interact with their environment. I use quantitative methods to investigate the drivers and outcomes of cognition. I test animals, in their natural habitat or in captivity under semi-natural conditions, to uncover how these cognitive processes vary across species and contexts.  I have had the opportunity to work with a variety of species, including both birds and mammals, depending on the questions at hand. My current work centers on the cognitive compromises of the common shrew, a model species for studying Dehnel’s phenomenon—a remarkable seasonal adaptation that affects brain size and behavior in small mammals.  Recently, I became more involved in open science practices, and I aim to advance openness, transparency and reproducibility in my daily life as a researcher. I’ve had the opportunity to participate to the Open Science Summer School organised by the Max Planck Digital Library and the LMU Open Science Center, where I learned practical tools and strategies to make research more accessible and collaborative."

    "text": "Previous Life\n Before becoming a scientist, I was a violinist, a journey that started when I was five. Over the years, I performed with various orchestras, including the United Europe Chamber Orchestra (UECO), and eventually, this work helped pay for my university studies.  While music has always been a passion, science turned out to be an even stronger driver, leading me to make the switch from professional musician to biologist.  I still enjoy playing the violin for myself and appreciate the creativity and focus it brings to my life."
