## The challenge of being small {#shrew}

:::{.cr-section layout="overlay-center"}

I study the common shrew (*Sorex araneus*), a tiny mammal with a  metabolism so *extreme* that even a few hours without food can be fatal. @cr-shrew

This high metabolism makes them particularly vulnerable to seasonal changes, and it makes it **impossible for them to hibernate during winter**. Their solution? They **shrink**.

Unlike animals that grow steadily over years, shrews undergo a radical transformation within a single lifetime. @cr-shrew-overlay

This dramatic change, **Dehnelâ€™s Phenomenon**, reduces their brain, bones, and organs to save energy in winter scarcity, regrowing them in spring for breeding.

How does it work? @cr-shrew-cycle

Born in **summer**, shrews rapidly reach peak brain size. This is the largest their brains will ever be.  [@cr-shrew-cycle]{pan-to="50%,-20%" scale-by="1.8"}

As **winter** sets in, the shrew shrinks their brains and bodies, reducing energy needs. [@cr-shrew-cycle]{pan-to="-10%,-20%" scale-by="2"}

By **spring**, they double their winter mass, gearing up to reproduce. [@cr-shrew-cycle]{pan-to="-50%,-5%" scale-by="1.7"}

Shrews **live only about a year**, so this transformation happens just once.  @cr-shrew-cycle

What happens *cognitively* when brains shrink and regrow? @cr-shrew-cognitionbw

My research explores what happens when their brain changes size: @cr-shrew-cognition

How does brain size affect cognitive abilities? @cr-shrew-lightbulb

Does a smaller brain lead to simpler decision-making? @cr-shrew-decisionmaking

These questions go *beyond just shrews*. Understanding how an animal maintains function despite physical changes in the brain helps us explore broader ideas in **neurodegeneration** and **energy efficiency**.

## Does captivity influence learning? {#shrew-captivity}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-asp: 1.2
#| message: false
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
raw_data <- readRDS("data/al_data.rds")
model_data <- readRDS("data/al_fitted.rds")
```

Brain size is of course only part of the story... environment shapes behavior too. @cr-captive-shrew

In *captivity*, animals face new challenges.  Do shrews kept in captivity learn differently than those in the wild? @cr-captive-shrew

I tested the ability of shrews to associate an odor cue with a reward in a Y-maze **associative learning task**. @cr-shrew-empty-plot  

Each **dot** represents an individual shrew's decision in a trial.  The **x-axis** represents the trial number, from 1 to 10. The **y-axis** shows whether they made the correct choice (**1**) or the wrong one (**0**). @cr-shrew-empty-plot  

**Summer wild (orange)** shrews had the highest and earliest success rates. @cr-shrew-summer-plot

**Winter wild (dark blue)** shrews showed a similar learning curve, but they learned at a slower rate and did not reach the **Summer** success rate. @cr-shrew-wild-plot

**Winter captive (light blue)** shrews showed no learning, never deviating from chance. @cr-shrew-complete-plot
